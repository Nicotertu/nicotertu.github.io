Welcome to Odyssey of the Dragonlords. This booklet
will provide you with everything you need to run an epic
campaign in the forgotten land of Thylea.
Odyssey of the Dragonlords is heavily inspired by
stories from ancient Greek mythology. As we designed
the campaign, we sought to include ideas from many
different sources: The Odyssey, The Iliad, Jason and the
Argonauts, The Oresteia, and others. However, Thylea is
not ancient Greece. You will not find Zeus, Athena, or
Apollo among the gods.
As you explore Thylea, you will encounter familiar
tropes, monsters, and treasures from Greek mythology-but the rules are different here. Mortals have
only recently come to these lands. The world of Thylea
blends high fantasy with the trappings of ancient history. Elves, dwarves, and halflings now live alongside
minotaurs, centaurs, and satyrs.
Our goal is to make your party feel like heroes from
one of the greatest stories ever told-but the ultimate
end of that story is entirely within your power. Your
players will make choices that forever change the world
of Thylea. As the gamemaster, we encourage you to
embrace this idea and run with it. How will your players
reshape history-and what does it mean to be a hero?

The city of Mytros is under attack by a colossal silver dragon, while two
heroes prepare to save the city. The Oracle has prophesied the Doom
of Thylea: the destruction of Mytros and the death of the gods. Who
will rise to save the forgotten land?

Preface: Why Greek Mythology?

The very first epic roleplaying campaign
took place over 3,000 years ago. A band of
heroes gathered to undertake an impossible
quest, and among them were the children of
Hermes, Apollo, Poseidon, and Zeus. They were the
Argonauts-the legendary sailors led by Jason. Their
ranks included Orpheus, the most talented musician in
the world, and Peleus, the father of Achilles. They were
even joined by Hercules, the famous warrior, who had
recently completed his fabled Twelve Labors.
Why should we liken the heroes of the Argonautika to
a party of roleplayers? Because in spite of their illustrious qualifications, and in spite of prophecies which
foretold success, the Argonauts were ill-equipped for
the challenges that awaited them. They abandoned their
quest almost as soon as they set sail, and the rest of the
story unfolds like a comedy of errors.
Fellow game masters, stop me if this sounds familiar.
Jason of Iolcos bears an uncanny resemblance to your
average tabletop roleplayer. When he isn't accidentally
slaughtering his own allies, he's wallowing in self-pity
and bemoaning his bad luck. He seems just as frightened
to lead the party as he is of being usurped. At multiple
points in the story, the gods are forced to step in and
save the Argonauts from his terrible leadership. In the
end, the Golden Fleece is secured through the magic of
the sorceress Medea. She isn't even counted among the
so-called heroes.
The heroes of Greek mythology are very different
from the super-powered, self-sacrificing paragons that
we've come to idolize in Hollywood films. In the Greek
epics, there is no clear line between good and evil, no
villains to thwart, no alien invasions to repel. Heroic
deeds are frequently puzzling and at times infuriating.
Odysseus punctuates his harrowing journey home by
murdering all the men who courted his wife. Achilles
refuses to fight when his men need him most. Jason
quickly abandons Medea once his quest is finished.
Because of their flaws, it is hard to shake the feeling
that the heroes of the Greek epics were real historical
figures. When might fails, they succeed through cunning, and when cunning fails, they succeed through
luck. These were mortal men cast into impossible situations, forced to survive through spectacular means, and
left to brood on the fickle whims of fate. In spite of their
divine parentage, they were, above all, very human.
This is in large part what makes these characters so
enduring in the Western imagination. But most importantly, it makes them the perfect archetypes for the
heroes of your next roleplaying campaign.


Preface - Why Greek My thology?

WHAT IS MYTHIC
HEROISM?

Odyssey of the Dragonlords casts your players into the
roles of mythic heroes, who have been the subjects of a
dire prophecy. This prophecy pits a small band of mortals against the last of the Titans-and promises an epic
conflict that will forever reshape the world of Thylea.

Gods and Kings
Mythic heroes have dealings with the gods, almost as
a matter of course. The gods are not always nice. They
are jealous, capricious, cruel, generous, vengeful, kind,
vicious, forgetful, thoughtless, lusty, selfish, passionate,
and generally all-too-human in their ways. They do not
know everything and cannot control everything, but
within their spheres of influence, they are awesome,
terrible, and dangerous. It's a foolish mortal who disrespects the gods. The wisest heroes acknowledge the
power of the gods over every aspect of life.
Mythic heroes must also contend with the will of
mortal kings and queens. Earth-shattering events
demand action from the most powerful rulers from
across the land, but their hands are often bound by the
vagaries of fate. Sometimes, they are forced to take up
arms and join the quest themselves, but more often they
must depend upon the might of famous heroes.

Oaths and Curses
Mythic heroes are often bound to their quest by powerful oaths. Oaths are inviolable sacred vows that are
sworn only in the most serious of circumstances. Oaths
have a powerful, far-reaching effect on society. They
may create peace between the gods, promote unbreakable fellowships, and even instigate bloody wars.
No mortal of sound mind would ever dare break
an oath, lest they be afflicted by terrible curses. To be
cursed by the gods is to be cursed by the land itself.
Food turns to dust in the mouths of those who are
cursed. Harpies peck out their eyes, and their souls are
dragged screaming into the Underworld.
For this reason, even the bravest of heroes fear the
consequences of breaking an oath. The gods, on the
other hand, are literally incapable of breaking their
oaths, for they are made from the same magic that binds
and enforces them.

Fame and Hubris
All great heroes seek to increase their fame. This may
sound like vanity, but within a mythic context, fame is
essential to achieving one's goals. Famous heroes may
summon warriors to their aid, influence the opinions of
the masses, and even demand audiences with the gods.

Though seeking it may shorten one's life, fame is the
most direct route to immortality.
But the danger of increasing one's fame is hubris.
Excessive pride, or hubris, leads to the downfall and
destruction of many famous heroes who overestimate
their abilities-or who underestimate the gods.

Fate and Prophecy
Mythic heroes are subject to the forces of fate and
prophecy in equal measure. Fate directs the lives of both
gods and mortals, and though she is the greatest of all
mysteries, she is also cruel to those who defy her. The
greatest gift she gives us is the gift of prophecy.
Prophecies reveal paths that would otherwise be
hidden to us-paths which allow us to rise to our fate,
rather than be destroyed by it. Such paths are often dangerous, and walking them may seem like madness, but
that is the task of the mythic hero. To dismiss prophecy
and spurn one's fate is hubris of the highest order.

Comedy and Tragedy
In the end, the story of a mythic hero falls into one of
two categories. Those who win fame by rising to their
fate and honoring their oaths may be forced to make
tragic sacrifices, but they will be happier in the end. On
the other hand, those who turn from fate, break their
oaths, and curse the gods will meet tragic endings, even
if their lives are happier in the short run.
In other words, mythic heroism means rising to the
challenges that fate throws at you, even when the gods
themselves work against you. It means losing yourself in
the wilderness for decades, only to return in glory when
your enemies least expect it. It also means betraying
your loved ones, overthrowing rightful kings because of
petty grievances, and discovering that you were a pawn
of prophecy all along.
Mythic heroes do not lead easy lives, but they do lead
dramatic ones. It's not just the victories that make their
adventures memorable-it's the failures, also.

Introduction

T

his book is designed to help you run a
story-driven roleplaying campaign that combines classic fantasy dungeon crawling with
the epic sweep of Greek mythology. It takes
place in the world of Thylea-a forgotten continent
where fey creatures make war upon civilization and gods
walk the earth in the guise of mortals.
The campaign is designed for the 5th Edition of the
world's greatest roleplaying game. It has been designed
for a party of 4-6 heroes of 1st level. By the end of the
campaign, the heroes should be 15th level or higher.
Odyssey of the Dragonlords combines an epic story
with a structured, open world. As the players complete
major milestones in the story, new parts of the world will
become available for them to explore. The story is divided
into a prologue and five acts, the last being an epic finale.
The goal of this adventure is to explore what it means
to be a hero in a land where gods and Titans still walk
the earth-where the forces of civilization are only just
beginning to prevail against the monsters that haunt the
seas and the forests. Your players will take on the role
of mythic heroes charged with fulfilling a prophecy and
confronting the Titans. Their decisions will shape the
future and forever change the world of Thylea.
Warning: Major Story Spoilers
This book is intended for the GM only. It contains major
spoilers for the story. Everything you need to know
about the world as a player can be learned by reading the
Player's Guide to Odyssey of the Dragonlords.
Reading this section-or any part of this adventure
book-may ruin several major surprises that are best
experienced at the table. Proceed at your own risk!

STORY OVERVIEW

This section covers the major concepts in the story.
More detailed information can be found in the History
of Thylea section or in the Secrets and Myths appendix.

Ancient Thylea
For many ages, Thylea was a wilderness of centaurs,
satyrs, cyclopes, and other creatures who worshipped
their native gods, the Titans. Mortals who came to
Thylea lived in small, defenseless tribes-until the
arrival of the Dragonlords.

6

The Five Gods
When all seemed lost, the mortals of Thylea were saved
by the sudden appearance of the Five Gods, who walked
the land in mortal guise. They forced the Titans into a
temporary truce, called the Oath of Peace.

The Oath of Peace
The Oath of Peace has prevented open warfare with
the Titans for five hundred years. But now, the truce
is ending. The power of the Five Gods wanes, and the
Titans prepare to wage war upon mortals once again.

The Oracle's Prophecy
At the beginning of the story, the heroes are chosen by
the Oracle to confront the ancient Titans and end the
conflict once and for all. This requires them to fulfill the
Oracle's prophecy and rebuild the ancient order of the
Dragonlords.

The Villains
The story has three major villains.
Sydon, Lord of Storms
Sydon is the ancient Titan who once ruled over Thylea,
long before the arrival of mortals. He seeks to dominate
the land once again-to be worshipped by all mortals.
Lutheria, Mistress of Death
Lutheria is another ancient Titan. She is the sister-wife
of Sydon. She has dominion over the underworld, and
she seeks to corrupt mortals and capture their souls for
her own amusement.
King Acastus of Mytros
Acastus is the last descendant of the Dragonlords. He
is a cowardly manipulator who seeks to undermine the
heroes and wrap himself in the glory of his ancestors.

THE WORLD OF THYLEA

Thylea is located across a great expanse of ocean, far
beyond the borders of the known world. It is a land
of great beauty and ancient splendor, untouched and
unspoiled by civilization since the dawn of time.
Thylea is sometimes called "the Lost Land." It has a
large central landmass which tapers into peninsulas
surrounded by hundreds of islands. Beyond that, on all
sides a clear expanse of ocean called the Forgotten Sea
stretches for a thousand miles in every direction.
Sprawling ruins, glittering lagoons, and massive
statues dot Thylea's landscape. Great beasts wander
her plains, and fey creatures haunt her woods. Centaur
tribes war for control on the steppes, and reptilian savages battle across her islands. Although Thylea is a land
with a long history, most of it has been lost.
At the heart of the archipelago the Mother Goddess,
in the form of a colossal world-tree, watches over her
creation. She is also called Thylea, and her true name is
lost to time. Her children are Sydon and Lutheria, the
Twin Titans, who dwell in the far reaches of the ocean.
They are the masters of everything under the endless
expanse of the sky.

THE HISTORY OF THYLEA
Arrival of Mortals
In the centuries before the founding of Mytros, mortals
had no dominion over the untamed lands of Thylea.
When elves, dwarves, and humans washed up on
Thylea's shores, their weapons failed them, and their
magic ceased to work. They were forsaken by their gods,
forced to live as beggars among the fey races.
Curious about these strange refugees, the nymphs and
satyrs offered them hospitality, and many small settlements were founded. The centaurs, however, offered
them no quarter, and the cyclopes were known to
devour men whole. Life in Thylea was short and brutal
for the so-called 'trespassers' from foreign lands.
During this era, the Twin Titans wielded great powers,
unlike anything seen since the dawn of time. Sydon
was venerated as the Lord of Storms. He could conjure
apocalyptic storms with his right hand and cataclysmic
earthquakes with his left hand. His sister-wife Lutheria
held dominion over the land of dreams, and her voice
was said to give life to the dead.
Fearing eradication, the desperate mortal settlers built
shrines to Sydon and held feasts in Lutheria's honor.
Thousands of sacrifices were dedicated to the Lord of
Storms, and libations of wine were poured to the Lady of
Dreams at every meal. The twins were at first unswayed
but, over time, they warmed to the persistent worship of
the hapless settlers.
In exchange for this devotion, the Titans offered the
mortals oaths of protection, which shielded them from

the worst ravages of the centaurs and cyclopes. The settlements survived, but they were always at the mercy of
the Twins. So it remained for many hundreds of years.

Arrival of the Dragonlords
One fateful day, a flight of powerful bronze dragons
arrived on Thylea's shores, each bearing a great champion from the Old World. These were the legendary
warriors known as the Dragonlords, and they heralded
an upheaval that would forever change the history of
the Forgotten Land.
Within just a few years of their arrival, many small
cities were founded, and a half-dozen small kingdoms
sprang up along the roads of the western reaches. The
Dragonlords founded powerful dynasties, and the
humble mortals who had once lived in terror of the
Titans now abandoned their temples and stood tall.
The Dragonlords were symbols of hope for a beleaguered people. Whenever any mortal settlement was
razed to the ground by roving centaurs and cyclopes,
the Dragonlords would repay the attackers in kind.
Through harsh winters, blistering summers, and relentless assaults by the native races, the Dragonlords fought
tirelessly, and the people of Thylea persevered.
Everywhere the dragons were greeted with shouts of
adulation. When spotted flying overhead, they would
be hailed as saviors, and great songs and feasts would
be held in their honor. They were radiant to behold,
bronze scales gleaming like fire. To be visited by one of
the dragons was to be blessed; and nowhere was more
blessed than the City of Mytros.
But the great powers that ruled Thylea grew jealous. Sydon and Lutheria, the Twin Titans, immortal
children of the mother goddess, amassed great armies
to eradicate the city. The Dragonlords responded by
gathering all the mortals in Thylea into a united assault
on the native races, and so began the First War.
Introduction

7

The First War
The histories of the First War are vague, having been
passed down through the centuries in the form of decaying scrolls and tapestries. What is known for certain is
that the native races were driven into exile. The centaurs
retreated into the steppes, while the satyrs fled into the
forests. The Gygans, an ancient civilization of cyclopes,
were annihilated, leaving behind the crumbling ruins of
their fallen cities.
The cost of victory was great: by the time the war
ended, the last of the dragons had been killed defending the city they loved most. Although the Dragonlords
are remembered as the great heroes of this age, their
noble dragons came to be equally venerated as guardian spirits. The blood of their sacrifice is woven into
the stones of Mytros, and to this day the city is said to
glow radiant bronze at sunset.
Perhaps most miraculous of all, however, was the
appearance of the Five Gods. These immortal figures
descended from heaven when the tide had turned against
the Dragonlords. Some have claimed that they were manifestations of Thylea's own desire to protect her immigrant children. They took the form of mortal men and
women, but their eyes were alight with the fire of divinity.
Don't Spoil the Twist!
The people of Thylea do not know the true nature of the
Five Gods. Only the gods know it, and they are forbidden
to talk about it by the Oath of Peace. The story finale
includes a major twist where the Five Gods return to their
true forms. Don't spoil this epic moment for your players!

Each of these new gods manifested some portion of
the power that had once belonged to the Titans. Pythor,
the Lord of Battle, took command of the centurions of
Mytros and, after many gruesome battles, the armies
of the native races were broken. When the final spear
had been thrust into the heart of the Gygan King, the
Five Gods fell into a torpor, apparently to recover their
strength. The city, it seemed, was safe.
But Sydon and Lutheria swore vengeance. The mountains shook, the seas boiled with rage, and spine-chilling
nightmares descended upon the mortal armies. Such
was the anger of the Titans that their retaliation threatened to sunder the very foundations of Thylea.
In the end, Mytros, the goddess of dawn, sacrificed
herself and ascended once more to the heavens in order
to rescue her beloved city from destruction.

The Oath of Peace
Having lost their mounts, the Dragonlords commissioned a fleet of warships and took to the seas. The
greatest of these ships was called the Ultros, captained
by one Estor Arkelander. He is said to have sailed into
8

Introduction

the very depths of the underworld where Lutheria sleeps
upon her diamond throne. The other Dragonlords are
said to have ascended Phraxys, the Tower of Sydon,
where the Lord of Storms watches all.
Many songs are sung of the trials and troubles of the
Dragonlords, but few can say what actually transpired
during their final journey into the perils of the Forgotten
Sea. The priests of Mytros watched for signs of the
impending apocalypse. On the night of the winter solstice, when Thylea's doom seemed near, the boiling seas
suddenly calmed and the nightmares ended.
Some days later, a black ship sailed into the harbor of
Mytros, carrying the bodies of many of the Dragonlords.
The ship was captained by Damon, a powerful wizard
who had served the Dragonlords during the First War.
He was mortally wounded, but he uttered not a single
word. He delivered three precious items to the Temple
of the Five, and then vanished in his ship, along with the
bodies and arms of his fallen masters.
One of the items that Damon carried was a scroll of
parchment, upon which was written the Oath of Peace.
This Oath was cause for great celebration. Sydon and
Lutheria had sworn not to take vengeance upon the
mortals of Thylea for a period of 500 years, provided
that daily sacrifices to the Titans should resume, and
that their temples should be maintained and honored.

The Present Day
The Oath of Peace has prevailed for 500 years and,
throughout this age, the mortals of Thylea have flourished. The City of Mytros grew into a great metropolis,
and it has been protected by the twin Colossi, beacons
of civilization on the shores of a dark frontier. More
settlers came from beyond the Forgotten Sea, and the
ranks of humans, dwarves, and elves grew. The remaining Dragonlords became kings and established dynasties
to rule over the new cities that were founded across the
land. As the worship of the Five spread, so also did their
power over the land and oceans grow, until every village
boasted shrines to Volkan and Pythor, and the dominion
of Sydon and Lutheria was nearly forgotten.
The Five Gods loved their people and made sure to
walk amongst them whenever they could.
While five centuries may seem like an eternity, the
time now grows near where this period of peace must
finally come to an end.

The Oracle's Prophecy
With the imminent end of the Oath of Peace, the Oracle
has prophesied the Doom of Thylea: the death of the
gods, the destruction of the sacred tree, and the total
annihilation of all mortal races.
Players in this campaign will take on the role of a group
of heroes who have been summoned to the Temple of the
Oracle in an attempt to avert this catastrophe.

TRAVELING TO THYLEA

THE POWERS OF THYLEA

Adventurers who explore the oceans of their world
to their farthest reaches will eventually discover the
Maelstrom: a terrifying region of hurricanes, whirlpools, and jagged rocks. Drunken sailors often boast of
death-defying encounters within the Maelstrom, but
none who have sailed its waters have ever returned.
Adventurers who brave the Maelstrom must spend
days battling storms, skirting whirlpools, and navigating
through treacherous shoals. The passage is so intense
that the crew is likely to be rendered unconscious.
Lucky adventurers will awaken in calmer waters, under
a cloudless sky-a glittering green expanse known as the
Forgotten Sea.
The Forgotten Sea stretches for hundreds of miles
in every direction, and it boasts hundreds of islands.
Powerful ocean currents prevent ships from approaching
these islands, and any attempt to do so will cause a ship to
lose control and be smashed on a rocky shoreline.
Watchful sailors may glimpse strange things on
the islands: impossibly tall humans in fine clothing,
monstrous reptilian beasts, and great stone carvings
in the shape of human faces. Intrepid explorers will
eventually catch sight of a towering bronze colossus
shining brightly on the horizon. This beacon serves to
guide ships into the harbor of Mytros, the greatest city
in Thylea.

The Ancient Titans
The Titans are divine powers native to Thylea. They
have existed since the dawn of time.
Thylea, Great Mother of All
Thylea is the namesake of the Lost Land. She takes the
form of a gargantuan tree on an island at the heart of the
Cerulean Gulf, and her followers believe that her roots
reach deep into the earth, binding the world together in
an eternal embrace. Thylea is believed to be a generous,
life-giving goddess. The Druids of the Oldwood believe
that her will is communicated through the changing of
the seasons, rather than through words. Long winters,
for example, signal her displeasure; long summers are a
sign of her approval.
Kentimane, The Hundred Handed
Kentimane was the most powerful of the Titans. He is
believed to be both the husband and eternal guardian of
the Great Mother. Many references are found to him in
the poetry of the gygans and the centaurs, but few credible sources have survived the ravages of time.
Kentimane is usually depicted with one hundred
heads and one hundred hands.
Sydon, The Lord of Storms
Sydon is the Lord of the Oceans and all that flows from
them. He takes the form of a colossal, bearded man with
three eyes, and he carries a terrifying black glaive. He
surveys both land and water tirelessly, summoning storms
to punish those who displease him. Sydon is a jealous and
vengeful god who makes no allowances for the worship of
any god but himself or his sister-wife, Lutheria.

Discovering the Lost Continent
Thylea may be found in almost any adventure setting. It
exists beyond the boundaries of all maps, and its location
is unknown to even the most experienced travelers.
Sailors often shipwreck here from other worlds.

Introduction

Every temple in Thylea fears the wrath of Sydon.
Daily sacrifices are offered to him in every village, even
as the settlers continue their silent prayers to the Five.
Whenever thunder rolls through the skies of Thylea, you
can be sure that someone has provoked Sydon's anger.

Mytros,
the Goddess
of Dawn

Lutheria, The Lady of Dreams
Lutheria takes the form of a beautiful, black-eyed woman
who sleepwalks through the underworld, greeting the
spirits of the dead. She carries a crystal scythe, which
she uses to harvest the souls of those who displeased her
in life. Lutheria commands her followers to live without
remorse, to drink, dance, and feast to their heart's desire,
because any day could be their last. She is a mother to
the fey races of Thylea, who she strongly favors.
Worship of Lutheria is rare among settlers, but she
is nevertheless honored with many feasts and festivals
because Sydon demands it. Whenever any drink is
poured, a libation must be made to Lutheria or else a
swift punishment is sure to follow.

The Five Gods
The Five Gods are widely celebrated as the settlers' favored
gods. With the exception of Mytros, they are not heaven-dwelling deities but familiar faces who walk among
their people. They have been known to take mortal husbands and wives, rule over cities, and sire demi-god children. They helped the Dragonlords and the mortal races
to defeat Sydon and Lutheria during the First War. For
centuries, they have blessed the mortal races, protecting
them from tyrannical domination by Sydon and Lutheria.
Shrines to the Five gods can be found in nearly every
settler household. Prayers to the Five must be accompanied by the sign against the evil eye to ward off the
jealous gaze of Sydon and Lutheria.
Mytros, The Goddess of Dawn
Mytros, called by some the 'Silver Queen' is the most
benevolent of the Five Gods and the patron goddess
of the most important kingdom in Thylea. She is
widely credited with the survival of the city during
the destruction and aftermath of the First War, and
she is said to appear to her priests as a warrior queen
clad in shimmering golden armor. Having ascended to
the heavens after a cataclysmic battle with Sydon and
Lutheria, she no longer walks among mortals. She is
the most powerful of the Five Gods, and the source of
most priestly magic in Thylea.
Volkan, The God of Forges
Not much is known about Volkan except that he is the
husband of Mytros. He concerns himself with artifice
and crafting and is primarily worshipped by dwarves,
smiths, and wizards. He is depicted as an elderly and
wise-looking man (and sometimes as a dwarf ). He is
rumored to travel through the Heartlands on the winter
solstice, distributing toys and sweets to children.

The goddess of dawn took her name from the city she
loved. She died protecting Mytros during the First War
and ascended to the heavens. We humble priests still draw
upon the power of her magic.
- Aesop of the Dragon Shrine
Pythor, The God of Battle
A son of Mytros and Volkan, Pythor appeared to the
settlers during the First War and fought tirelessly
against the centaurs and gygans that threatened to
overwhelm the city of Mytros. His praises were sung
for centuries after, and he is said to have walked among
the settlers in mortal guise, taking women to his bed
and fathering demi-god children. A few centuries ago
he became the king of the city of Estoria when he overthrew a mad tyrant.
Vallus, The Goddess of Wisdom
Vallus is revered as the goddess of wisdom and beauty,
and she is believed to know as much about Thylea's
history as Sydon and Lutheria. She was once known to
travel far and wide, surveying ancient ruins and collecting lore concerning the origins of the land and the
fey races. Prayers are offered to Vallus when guidance
is needed and information is scarce. She is the oldest
daughter of Mytros and, in many ways, she has inherited
her mother's legacy, serving as both queen and patron
goddess to the city.
Introduction

11

Kyrah, The Goddess of Music
Kyrah is revered as the trickster goddess of music and
poetry. She is the swiftest of all the gods, capable of disappearing in the blink of an eye and she can travel great
distances with each step. Her voice is said to be more
beautiful than any musical instrument. There are very
few shrines to her, except among bards, who revere her
as the Muse.

THE MORTAL KINGDOMS
The Kingdom of Mytros
The city of Mytros was the first settlement founded by
the Dragonlords. It was protected by the Goddess of
Dawn and grew into a mighty kingdom after the end of
the First War. It is the largest city in all of Thylea and the
center of commerce, religion, and politics. The Great
Games are held outside of the city once a year. The
Temple of the Five stands at the center of the city, but
in recent years the worship of Sydon has been growing
in popularity. The Titan now has his own grand temple
that stands across the street from the Temple of the Five.
Mytros is ruled by the mighty King Acastus, the last
true descendant of the Dragonlords. Acastus is revered
across all of Thylea and he is the husband of Queen
Vallus, the wisest of the Five Gods. Through some
miraculous feat of magic, he has recently resurrected the
race of dragons, which were thought to be extinct since
the end of the First War. He now seeks to rebuild the
ancient order of the Dragonlords and restore the city of
Mytros to its former glory.

The Kingdom of Estoria
Estoria is an ancient stronghold that has resisted centuries of attacks by centaurs, cyclopes, manticores, and
other dangers which thrive on the steppes beyond the
Arkelon River. The king of Estoria is Pythor, the mightiest of the Five Gods. He rules from his palace at the
highest vantage point in the city.
From his throne, Pythor can survey the sprawling
farmlands of his kingdom to the south and watch vigilantly for any new threats that might emerge from the
north. Although the Estorians are considered provincials by the people of Mytros, everyone knows that the
greatest warriors and adventurers of this age are forged
in the service of the Lord of Battle.

Introduction

The Kingdom of Aresia
The kingdom of Aresia has long been a rival to the
kingdom of Mytros. The two cities have been engaged
in dozens of wars over the last several hundred years,
which are collectively known as the Aresian campaigns.
The reasons for the fighting vary, but one thing is certain: warriors on both sides seek glory in battle.
The warrior monks of the eastern shore are amongst
the most feared fighters in all of Thylea. Their children
begin training with spears from the day they take their
first steps, and every adult is required to serve in the
militia. Aresians spend their lives in pursuit of 'degrees'
in schools of martial philosophy, which have been
refined over many centuries of defending their borders.
Aresian warriors cultivate an air of rugged austerity
out of a sense of pride in their history, but it disguises
long hours spent on beauty rituals, poetry readings,
and decadent feasting. The most powerful families in
Aresia are those which take the greatest pains to appear
ascetic-eating unspiced gruel and wearing little to
nothing in public, while lavishing fine foods and luxurious garments on their servants in paradoxical and
conspicuous displays of wealth. The highest caste warriors make a point of leading lifestyles that most closely
resemble those of their hard-pressed ancestors.

Barbarians of the Gulf
For millennia before the coming of the Dragonlords,
outsiders would occasionally wash up on the shores of
Thylea. These were usually shipwrecked explorers or
merchants who were blown far off course. Of all races
and nationalities, these people had to live in harmony
with the natives of Thylea. They formed tribes and
lived on the islands of the Cerulean Gulf. When the
Dragonlords came, these tribes fought with the natives
of Thylea against the newcomers. In present times the
barbarians are still looked upon with fear and distrust by
the civilized races. They are seen as being as dangerous
as the centaur tribes or fey creatures of the Oldwood.
The most feared of the barbarian tribes are the Amazons
that dwell upon the island of Themis.

PEOPLE OF THYLEA

Thylea is home to many different races, only some of
whom are native to her shores. Thyleans are collectively referred to as mortals-even those with very
long lifespans. For more information about Thylea's
native races, including their origin myths and physical
descriptions, refer to the Playable Races appendix.

Native Races
• Centaurs, Satyrs, and Sirens. These creatures have

existed in Thylea for thousands of years. They are
common in rural areas but somewhat rare in cities.
• Gygans. The gygans are a race of ancient cyclops that
were mostly exterminated during the First War.

• Medusae. Medusae are mortals who have been cursed

The Temple of the Oracle

Settler Races

The Oracle is a famous water nymph who dwells in the
hot springs below a temple south of Estoria. She has
the gift of prophecy, and her soothsaying is heeded by
gods and kings alike. Despite her heritage as a daughter of Sydon, she has always had a special fondness for
the mortals of Thylea, and she is attended by many
faithful priests.

by dark powers. They are secretive and very rare.
• Minotaurs. Minotaurs are cursed tribes of humans.
They are usually treated very poorly in cities.

• Humans. Humans are plentiful. Some were ship-

wrecked here thousands of years ago, and others came
over with the Dragonlords 500 years ago. Humans
populate all major cities and settlements.
• Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings. These races
are less common than humans, but they populate all
major cities and settlements in fair numbers.
• Half-orcs. Half-orcs are rare, and they are not stigmatized as they are in other lands. There are no orcs.
• Tieflings. Tieflings are called "Stygians" and assumed
to be servants of Lutheria. They are secretive and rare.
• Dragonborn. Dragonborn are exceedingly rare. If they
exist in Thylea, then they are hidden away in remote
places. Thyleans would be shocked to see one.

FACTIONS OF THYLEA
The Temple of the Five
The Temple of the Five was one of the first buildings
constructed in the city of Mytros, and is the oldest civic
building there. Elected representatives from the districts of Mytros and her outlying villages form a council
that meets at the temple every new moon. However,
the pattern of civic life is increasingly dictated by the
Order of Sydon, who believe that the Temple of the Five
should be destroyed in order to appease the Titans. King
Acastus has taken no sides in this conflict, but the peace
is becoming precarious.

Centurions of Mytros
The city of Mytros conscripts a regular army of centurions to enforce the law of the land. The centurions
have a history that dates back to the First War, when
they followed Pythor into battle against the centaurs
and gygans. Although the centurions honor Mytros at
religious festivals, nearly every soldier prays openly to
Pythor, the god of battle. The highest-ranking centurion
is King Acastus who commands the army and serves as
the final arbiter of justice for the city.

The Academy at Mytros
The Academy was formed centuries ago and is the
center of learning in Thylea. The great wizard Damon
was one of its founders, but it wasn't only an institution
for magical learning. It was also a place for philosophy and other intellectual pursuits. Now it consists of
many colleges devoted to the different schools of magic
(divination, evocation, etc.) and to safeguarding the lore
of Thylea. It is also a place where Thylea's interests in
theater, song, and other arts are encouraged.

The Druids of Oldwood
Deep within the Oldwood is a druid grove ringed by
monolithic stones. The druids of Oldwood are whiteclad men and women who wear laurels and wield oaken
staves. They worship the mother goddess Thylea, and
believe that the people of Mytros should never have settled
in her Heartlands. They perform a daily ritual sacrifice
to Thylea, hoping to atone the sins of the mortal races.

The Order of Sydon
The Order of Sydon are zealots who revere the ocean
titan Sydon above all other gods. They watch for signs
from the heavens-lightning strikes in particular-and
their priests communicate the will of the ocean god
to the council of Mytros. The ranks of the order are
filled with heavily-armored paladins who wear cerulean
cloaks and golden clasps, but they welcome true believers from any warrior background. The Order wishes
only to enforce the will of Sydon, and they have been
known to destroy shrines to the Five.

The Cult of the Snake
This thieves' guild operates in the shadows of Mytros.
They are headquartered deep within the aqueducts.
The cultists have recently been breaking into the homes
of wealthy citizens, stealing everything of value, and
leaving entire families petrified. The leader of the cult is
someone who calls herself the Lady of Coins.

Lost Tribe of the Gygans
The gygans were Sydon's favored people, six armed
giants with a single eye. Once the greatest civilization in
Thylea, the Gygan Empire fell during the First War. The
ruins of this empire can be found on countless islands
throughout the Cerulean Gulf. The few surviving gygans
keep to themselves, but take any opportunity for vengeance against the hated settler races.

Centaurs of the Steppes
The centaurs of the Steppes are a nomadic people
divided into dozens of warring tribes. They move
through the hills in thunderous stampedes, hunting,
foraging, and raiding the camps of other peoples.
Centaurs hold themselves to a strict code of honor, and
the children of warriors slain in battle are adopted and
raised as part of the conquering tribe. During times of
Introduction

13

truce, the centaur tribes set up camps along the steppe
rivers, drink honeymeade under the stars, and sing tales
of ancient Thylea.

The Raving Ones
The Raving Ones are a den of fey creatures who worship
Lutheria. On the edges of the Oldwood, west of Atrokos,
there is a system of caves where they are said to dwell.
They sometimes travel along the roads in the guise of
maidens in distress, luring travelers back to the den to
be torn apart and devoured in rituals to the goddess of
revelry. The Raving Ones are the mothers of the goatlings,
who are born from the union of a satyr and a Maenad.

THE LAWS OF THYLEA

There are several aspects of Thylea that are different
from a typical fantasy world. Oaths are expected to
be honored upon the life of the swearer, and guests
can expect to be shown hospitality even in the homes
of their fiercest enemies. When these ancient laws of
Thylea are disobeyed, the resulting punishment can
forever change the life of a hero.
Oaths and curses are not enforced by any particular
titan or god. These are natural laws that were woven
into the fabric of Thylea at the dawn of time. Even
Sydon and Lutheria must honor their oaths or suffer
dreadful consequences.

Guest Friendship
Guest friendship is a concept of great import in the lands
of Thylea. It requires that all hosts show generosity and
courtesy to guests who are far from home, no matter
what disputes may divide the two parties. For guest
14

Introduction

friendship to be established, a host must invite someone
into their home and provide them with food or drink.
It is expected that the guest should provide a gift to
the host to seal the friendship, but the bond is established as soon as the guest has shared a meal with
the host. The bond of guest friendship ends when the
guest has departed with the host's blessing. After that,
the two may become enemies once more.
However, if one party brings about harm to the
other while the bond is in effect, then the friendship
is broken, and the offending party is now subject to
the curse of the treacherous. The Furies are widely
known to be the arbiters of such disputes, and few are
willing (or foolish enough) to suffer their wrath.

Sacred Oaths
Oaths are sworn between men and their kings all the
time, but oaths between men and gods are rarer and
more binding. Oaths sworn to powerful creatures of the
Fey, or to demons and devils can be just as binding.
Oath of Peace
An oath of peace is one where a powerful creature or
king demands that the person swearing the oath will
commit no violence against them or any of their servants. There is almost always a time limit to such an oath.
Sometimes the time limit can be weeks or months, but
other times it may be years or centuries. An oath of
peace is central to the story presented in this book.
Oath of Protection
An oath of protection is one in which a powerful individual is sworn to come to the aid of another in a time
of great need. One of the most famous of these oaths

in mythology is the oath that the Achaean kings swore
to Menelaus, husband of Helen. The kings swore to
assist Menelaus if anyone ever threatened Helen. When
Menelaus called upon the kings to fulfill their oaths, the
Trojan War was the result.
An oath of protection requires the swearer to answer
a call for aid as quickly as possible. Once the threat has
been neutralized, the oath is fulfilled, and there is no
further obligation. Failure to answer the call, or even
allowing the other party to come to harm, will cause the
oath giver to be branded an oathbreaker, and they too
suffer the curse of the treacherous.
Oath of Service
An oath of service is an oath sworn by one individual to
another. The swearer is required to perform one task,
which does not need to be specified when the oath is
sworn. Unlike the oath of protection, this task could
be of any type: it may even require evil deeds, such as
assassination. For this reason, most people are hesistant
to ever swear such an oath, viewing it as a last resort.
When the oath swearer is called upon, they must
answer as quickly as possible. Once the task has been
completed, the oath is fulfilled and there is no further
obligation. Failure to answer the call, or refusal to complete the task, brands the swearer as an oathbreaker and
makes them subject to the curse of the treacherous.

Mortal Curses
Curses fall upon those who break oaths, break guest
friendship, make deals with powerful evil creatures or
anger the gods. Curses are not to be taken lightly: they
publicly and clearly mark a hero's untrustworthy quality
for everyone to see.
Curse of the Harpy
Any person afflicted with this curse will slowly transform into a harpy. It is sometimes invoked by powerful
fey creatures such as hags or nymphs when an oath is
unfulfilled, though sometimes the gods might punish a
mortal with this curse. The only way to stop the transformation is through powerful divine magic.

Curing the Curse. Casting the greater restoration
spell once per day for three days is required. Each time
the spell is cast, the transformation is slightly reversed.
However, the spell has no effect once the subject is
completely transformed at the end of week 4. Missing a
casting requires the whole process to begin again.
Harpy Ability: Luring Song. The harpy sings a
magical melody, and every humanoid and giant within
300 feet that can hear the song must succeed on a
DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the
song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on
its subsequent turns to keep singing, but it can stop
singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is
incapacitated.
While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated
and ignores all other charm effects. If the charmed
target is more than 5 feet from the harpy, they must
attempt to move toward the harpy by the most direct
route. The target doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but
it may repeat a saving throw before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava. A charmed victim should
also repeat a saving throw when it takes damage from
another character, as well as at the end of each of its
turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect
ends. Targets that successfully save are immune to this
ability for the next 24 hours.
Curse of the Medusa
A person cursed in this fashion will slowly transform
into a medusa. This curse usually comes from bargains
made with devils and demons: a mortal might have been
asking for beauty or eternal life, but instead was granted
the terrifying form of a medusa. Sometimes, ancient
fey creatures such as hags will transform a victim into a
medusa, often simply for amusement.
The transformation can be stopped with divine magic,
but without intervention the victim will transform
within a few weeks.

Curing the Curse. Someone must cast the greater
restoration spell on the creature once per day for three
days, and each time the spell is cast, the transformation
is reversed a little. The spells have no effect once the
subject has been completely transformed, and if a casting is missed the process must restart.
Medusa Abilities. These abilities are described in the
medusa playable race entry in the appendix.
Final Transformation. After 5 weeks have passed,
you may choose to follow the rules described in the
table above, but you may also allow an affected player to
re-create their character with the medusa playable race,
using the same level and class that they were before.
Curse of the Graverobber
This curse is visited upon someone who takes any
magical item from the grave of a hero blessed by the
gods. Those afflicted by this curse cannot eat. After a
number of days equal to their Constitution score, the
cursed character will gain one level of exhaustion every
day until they die from starvation. It is impossible for
the person to get rid of the magical item that they stole,
even by returning it to the correct grave. It will always
return to their possession at midnight.
Curing the Curse. Casting the greater restoration
spell on the affected creature will remove this curse.
The curse can also be removed by finding someone who
will take possession of the stolen magical item willingly. To do this, the cursed individual must be truthful
about the item's provenance. This would require a DC
20 Charisma (Persuasion) check on someone with an
Intelligence score of 10 or less.

Curse of the Treacherous
This curse afflicts those who abuse guest friendship
or break powerful oaths. Those who violate the tenets
of guest friendship are at risk of being cursed by the
offended host or guest. Breaking an oath made to the
gods will almost always cause the offending mortal to
be cursed, but a person might also become cursed for
breaking an oath to an especially powerful king, or even
a pious beggar. The effect of this curse is directly related
to the injustice of the offense.
Dispatching the Erinyes. The curse of the treacherous
manifests itself in a manner that is unique to Thylea.
The Furies, the three queens of the erinyes, gather in the
Room of Far Sight in Praxys to determine the severity
of the offense. When they have agreed upon a necessary
response, they dispatch 1-3 erinyes to punish the target.
These erinyes will hunt and try to capture their quarry
until they have been defeated. Those captured by erinyes
are taken to the Island of Oathbreakers in the Nether
Sea (area N), where they must live out the rest of their
miserable lives.
Hunting as the Erinyes. The erinyes are dispatched
from the Island of Oathbreakers, and they must first
track down their prey. This takes d100 hours. Every
erinyes dispatched in this manner possesses a rope of
entanglement. She also has a temporary special ability
that allows her to cast plane shift at will.
She is only able to cast plane shift on her quarry, and
only if the target is restrained by the rope of entanglement. If these requirements are satisfied, then the target
must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. Failing this
saving throw causes the target to be banished to the
Island of Oathbreakers in the Nether Sea.

Adventure Overview
Prologue: The Prophecy

Act 1: The Great Labors

The adventure begins in a rural inn called The Sour
Vintage. The heroes are summoned by the goddess
Kyrah, who has disguised herself as a traveling poet.
The Boar Hunt. Kyrah explains that the Oracle has
had a vision which revealed the heroes as the chosen
warriors who will prevent the 'Doom of Thylea.' In order
to confirm this, the heroes must defeat a monstrous
boar which the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria, sent to
ravage the countryside.
Temple of the Oracle. After dealing with the Great
Boar, the heroes travel to see the Oracle, who has been
captured by a hag. After rescuing her, the heroes learn
that they must complete three 'Great Labors' in order
to prepare for their confrontation with the Titans:

Kyrah suggests that the heroes begin their Labors in the
city of Estoria. Estoria is ruled by King Pythor, one of
the Five Gods, who should prove helpful.
The King's Daughter. But first, King Pythor needs
the heroes' assistance to rescue his daughter from being
sacrificed to Sydon. Once this is done, Pythor throws
a celebration for the heroes and offers them guidance
for their quest. The heroes also meet Pythor's father, an
absent-minded dwarf who claims to be the god Volkan.
The Great Labors. The heroes can use Estoria as a
base as they search for clues and complete each of the
Great Labors. The Labors require them to visit three
locations-The Mithral Mines, The Mossy Temple, and
The Necropolis at Telamok. Each of these dungeons can
be reached with a half-day journey from the city.
The Dream. Once the heroes recover the Horn of
Balmytria, they must drink from it to complete their

• Drink from the Horn of Balmytria
• Light the fires of the Mithral Forge
• Recover the weapons of the Dragonlords
16

Introduction

task. This triggers a dream where two more Labors are
revealed-the heroes must recover a ship called the
Ultros and an ancient artifact called the Antikythera.
Summoned to Mytros. Once the heroes have accomplished two of the Labors, King Acastus of Mytros sends
a detachment of soldiers mounted on dragons to invite
the heroes to his city for an audience. King Acastus
is revered across the lands, for he seeks to restore the
ancient order of the Dragonlords. The heroes should
finish their final Labor before answering the summons.

Act 2: The Dragonlords
When the heroes arrive in Mytros, the city is assailed by
hurricanes sent by Sydon, the Lord of Storms.
The Storm. As the Oracle's Chosen Ones, the heroes
are expected to quell the anger of the Titan, and they
are faced with a difficult choice. Once this is done, King
Acastus thanks the heroes and rewards them with a map
to the legendary trireme, the Ultros-the only ship that
can brave the storms of the Forgotten Sea.
The City of Mytros. The heroes meet Queen Vallus,
the goddess of wisdom, who offers the heroes counsel
and warns them about the king's ambitions. Afterwards,
the heroes are free to spend time exploring the city.
The Dead Falls. Eventually, the heroes must travel to
the Dead Falls to battle the undead crew of the Ultros
and recover the ship for themselves. They encounter the
ghost of an ancient Dragonlord, Estor Arkelander.
The Celebration. Once the Ultros has been recovered, the heroes return to Mytros, and Vallus throws a
massive celebration in their honor. She gives the heroes
an ancient navigational device called the Antikythera.
With this, the Great Labors are completed, and it's time
for the heroes to set sail to confront the Titans.
The Legendary Crew. Pythor crashes the celebration
with his father Volkan in tow. Pythor swears an oath of
service to the heroes and joins them aboard the Ultros,
while Volkan promises to forge them weapons at the
Mithral Forge. But the heroes must make haste-the
Oath of Peace will come to an end in sixty days, and the
Titans are preparing for war.
The Dragon Egg. Secretly, Vallus gives the heroes
another gift: a single dragon egg. This is the last dragon
egg that Acastus had in his possession. Kyrah reveals that
Lutheria gave several eggs to Acastus, and she fears that
the dragons will be used to wage war against all the mortals of Thylea. She asks the heroes to raise the egg and
prove that they are worthy to be the new Dragonlords.

Act 3: The Great Voyage

where Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon,
makes his base. Gaius and his knights have been a recurring problem for the heroes ever since the beginning of
their quest. He rides a silver dragon named Argyn.
The Forgotten Sea. This region is more dangerous
than the Cerulean Gulf and should not be braved lightly.
The heroes may sail into the mouth of Charybdis to
reach the Nether Sea. Alternatively, they may sail to
Praxys, the Tower of Sydon. There are many islands here
to explore, some of which are home to great treasures.
The heroes must use their time wisely.
The Nether Sea. This strange underworld is where
Lutheria dwells-aboard a roving barge called Hypnos,
the Throne of Dreams. The heroes must locate the
vessel in order to board it and confront the Titan. But
first, there are several islands to explore where the
heroes may learn some of her weaknesses.
Praxys, Tower of Sydon. This tower is where Sydon
has long dwelled, consolidating his power. The heroes
must scale this massive dungeon, floor by floor, to seek
out and confront the Lord of Storms. In the end, the
heroes are forced to reckon with the Titan's empyrean
children. Sydon meets the heroes but refuses a confrontation-he has plans in motion to attack Mytros.

Act 4: The Battle of Mytros
When the sixty days have passed, the Oath of Peace
ends, and the Titans are free to attack Mytros.
The Gods Transform. When the Oath of Peace ends,
the Five Gods revert to their true forms: they are dragons who had been imbued with divine power and locked
into mortal forms. Pythor, Kyrah, Volkan, and Vallus
agree to carry the heroes into battle against the Titans.
The Battle Begins. When the heroes reach Mytros,
the city is already under attack by an ancient silver
dragon that belongs to the king. King Acastus thought
to defend his city, but in his arrogance, he lost control of
the dragon. The heroes must defeat the dragon, confront
Acastus, and take control of the Colossus of Pythor.
The Titans Attack. The city faces three possible
attacks, depending on which of the Titans are still
alive at this point in the story. Sydon, Lutheria, and
Kentimane assail the city, seeking to either subjugate or
destroy it. The heroes must join with their dragons and
do everything possible to save the city.
The New Oath. In the end, the heroes are victorious.
Having defeated Sydon and Lutheria, they may force
the Titans to swear new oaths (if they survived). The
heroes may also swear an oath of protection to the city
of Mytros, to cement their legacy as Dragonlords.

Now that the heroes have the Ultros, they must seek out
and confront the Titans. However, the first thing they
need is the missing gear for the Antikythera.
The Cerulean Gulf. There are many islands for the
heroes to explore as they search for the gear. The gear
is located in the Great Library on the island of Yonder,
Introduction

17

Act 5: The New Pantheon
After the Battle of Mytros, the heroes are summoned by
one of the forgotten gods: Narsus, the god of beauty.
The Secrets of Godhood. When the Oath of Peace
ended, Narsus lost his divinity. Now, he wishes to
reclaim it. He sends a messenger to the heroes, who
promises that they might achieve godhood themselves.
But first, the heroes must rescue Narsus from his captivity in the city of Aresia-an ancient rival to Mytros.
The Siege of Aresia. After crossing the ocean to
Aresia, the heroes must decide how to deal with the
heavily-defended city. They are presented with a variety
of options, including the possibility of sneaking in while
their army sits at the gates. Once the heroes free Narsus
from his prison, he reveals what must be done next.
The Divine Artifacts. The heroes must reclaim three
key items that may be used to create a new pantheon
of gods. This quest takes them to two dungeons in the
Aresian peninsula-and then deep into the oceans to
the Sunken Kingdom, where a lost pantheon of gods has
been locked away for centuries.
The Apokalypsis. Once the items have been recovered, the world is ravaged by an apocalyptic event as
multiple gargantuan monsters descend upon Thylea.
The heroes must defeat the monsters, ascend to the
palace of the gods, and defeat the lost pantheon. In the
process, the heroes may unlock the secrets of godhood
and ascend to the heavens themselves.

STORY STRUCTURE

The world of Thylea has been designed with natural
'fences' that curb exploration until the players achieve
certain milestones. For example, players cannot explore
the Cerulean Gulf until they have acquired a ship. New
exploration regions unlock in the following order:

• Learning of the Prophecy...
...unlocks the Great Labors

• Completing the Great Labors...
...unlocks the City of Mytros

• Recovering the Ghost Ship...
...unlocks the Cerulean Gulf

• Exploring the Cerulean Gulf...
...unlocks the Forgotten Sea

• Confronting both of the Titans...
...triggers the Battle of Mytros

• Collecting the Divine Artifacts...
...triggers the Apokalypsis

As the GM, you may shepherd the party toward the
next milestone in the story, but for the most part, you
can allow your players freedom to explore.
The Battle of Mytros and the Apokalypsis are the epic
finales to the adventure, where all the twists and turns
of the story bear fruit. These events are ordained by fate
and cannot be avoided, but the manner in which they
unfold depends entirely upon your players.

Running the Adventure
This section contains advice to help you run the campaign. It describes how to roleplay all of the major characters in the story, how to run your players' epic paths,
and how to manage player character advancement.
Finally, it provides some tips on how to make adjustments to the campaign.

EPIC PATHS

Epic paths are an optional addition to character creation. They provide mythic archetypes for the player
characters, so that each hero feels larger-than-life, like
Hercules, Achilles, Odysseus, or Perseus.
Each player should choose one of the epic paths
described in the Epic Paths section of the Creating
Heroes appendix. This will determine their hero's mythic
context within the land of Thylea and influence relationships with her gods and people.

Standard Backgrounds
Epic paths are different from standard backgrounds in
that they are specific to this setting. They unlock new
aspects of the adventure, including special relationships
with story characters and access to specific magic items.
Players should choose a standard background in
addition to their epic path. This will provide them
with skills, tool proficiencies, languages, and starting
equipment. The flavor of the standard background
should be enhanced or replaced by the epic path's
description.

Heroic Tasks
Every epic path has a set of goals. While these goals
are personal to each hero, they are supplementary
to the overall goals of the adventure. When a hero

accomplishes their goals, they become blessed by the
gods. Each epic path has a different divine blessing that
is granted upon completion of its goals.
There are also magic items listed under the goals
for each of the epic paths. These items are usually
located in distant parts of Thylea and must be found
before they can be used. Other items must be forged
or otherwise crafted at specific locations, such as the
Mithral Forge.
Whenever an epic path offers a choice of multiple
magic items, the player should choose one, and you
should do your best to integrate that item into the story.

Story Connections
Epic paths are intended to help tie the heroes to the
story in a meaningful way. When you think of the
greatest fantasy epics, the heroes always have strong ties
to the story-special relationships with kings, queens,
villains, and gods. The heroes of these stories are important for reasons that go much deeper than the powers
and the items they wield.
Epic paths should not diminish player agency. Players
are free to pursue the story hooks presented in each
path in any way that the GM deems appropriate. They
are also free to modify an epic path with the agreement
of the GM. The GM should take care when modifying
the magic items, however, as the adventure is balanced
with these specific items in mind.

STARTING THE CAMPAIGN
Before you begin this campaign, you should decide
how your heroes relate to the lands of Thylea. Are they
strangers to these lands, or are they natives? This does
not alter the adventure's structure but it should shape
the way you introduce major conflicts and characters.

Forming the Party

Option 1: Sent by the Gods
If a majority of your heroes are from lands beyond the
Forgotten Sea, then they are believed to be sent by the
gods in Thylea's hour of greatest need. In this case, you
should begin with the following:




You have arrived in Thylea, a strange new land, after
crossing a great ocean. Shipwrecked with no means
of returning home, you were sheltered in your time of
need by the people of the great city of Mytros. Now, it
seems, the hour has come to repay their kindness.


Option 2: Destined for Greatness
If the majority of your heroes are native to Thylea, then
they are famous throughout the land as being destined
for greatness. In this case, you should begin as follows:


You are known throughout Thylea as mortals destined
to perform great deeds. The citizens of the great city
of Mytros already tell stories of your exploits, both real
and imagined. Now, it seems, the time has come for
you to rise and meet your fate.




Spreading Rumors
Before you begin your first session, consider giving your
players the following assignment. This exercise creates
a fun roleplaying moment to kick things off, and it helps
the heroes become better acquainted with one another
before they join forces.


Write your character's name at the top of three separate notecards. On each notecard, write one rumor
about your character that circulates in Thylea's taverns.
These may be rumors of your heroic exploits, ribald
jokes about your past exploits, or even mean-spirited
gossip. At least one of these rumors must be true, but
the others may be exaggerations or outright fabrications. Give your three notecards to the GM before the
start of the first adventure. Don't tell the other players
what you have written!

Before the adventure begins, shuffle each player's
notecards and hand them out to the other players at
20

Introduction

The best way to motivate your party in this campaign is
to focus on how the party's current goals align with the
personal goals in each of their individual epic paths.
However, you can also motivate the heroes by awarding Fame points when the party completes major story
objectives. As players earn Fame points, they unlock
new perks and prestige in the world of Thylea. These
perks are detailed in the Earning Fame section of the
Creating Heroes appendix.

Player Handouts
Give each player a copy of the Thylea World Primer
from the appendix. This serves as a handy reference
sheet for major concepts and characters that your players should be familiar with.
This book includes other handouts that can be used to
add flavor throughout the adventure, including maps for
many of the major islands. Make sure to prepare these
ahead of time for each session.

PLAYING THE VILLAINS




The heroes' party should be formed before you begin
the first adventure. They need not be very familiar
with each other yet: in these dark days, many bands of
strangers are gathering to take on the challenges facing
Thylea. Perhaps your heroes have arranged to meet for
the first time in The Sour Vintage.
Alternatively, you can use the conflicts presented in
the Prologue chapter to encourage your heroes to band
together. To encourage cooperation, you should cement
their newfound friendship with an oath of fellowship.

Motivating the Party





the table. No one should get one of their own notecards
back. Now, each player will have a chance to read some
juicy gossip about their fellow heroes.

Great stories have great villains. This section describes a
series of special events and dramatic confrontations that
will make the villains in your story memorable.

Sydon, Lord of Storms
Sydon primarily takes action against the party through
his legions of worshippers. These include the armies of
centaurs, cyclopes, gygans, and other native creatures
who revere him. He is also served by many mortals,
including the Temple of Sydon in Mytros and the fanatical zealot, Gaius, who commands the Order of Sydon.



Learning about Sydon
Sydon and his minions take action against the party
from the very beginning of the story. Members of the
Order of Sydon have been sent to kill the heroes before
they even have a chance to hear the Oracle's prophecy.

I still remember those quiet hours leading up to our first

Event: The Centaur Warband
After the heroes finish their first Labor, Gaius, the head
of the Order of Sydon, tracks them down from the skies,
riding his silver dragon, Argyn. He summons a centaur
warband to destroy the heroes.


battle against the armies of Sydon. We were not prepared

for the wrath of the Storm Titan.

- Rizon Phobas, Dragonlord (12 DA)



Dark clouds and thunder roll across the sky. You spot a
flash of silver in the clouds. At first, you mistake it for
lightning, but it slowly resolves into a magnificent silver
dragon. A blue-cloaked figure sits astride the dragon as
it circles overhead. The figure speaks:
"Give up your quest and prostrate yourselves before
the power of Sydon." His voice abruptly changes to
something far deeper and inhuman, "You meddle with
forces beyond your comprehension."
The dragon vanishes into the clouds above, and
lightning tears across the sky. The ground shakes as
something thunders toward you. It's a bloodthirsty
warband of charging centaurs!


There are alternative ways to avoid being sunk. A
sacrifice to Sydon will calm his anger, but it must be a
white ox or an intelligent creature. The control weather
spell can be used to neutralize the storm. A conjured air
or water elemental can guide the ship out of danger.



The warband includes one centaur for every hero. They
will battle the heroes for two rounds and then abruptly
turn away and retreat, leaving their dead behind.

Event: Sydon's Fleet
This encounter occurs after the heroes have defeated or
made a pact with Lutheria. It can also happen at a time
of your choosing before the heroes have defeated either
Lutheria or Sydon. This event can help motivate heroes
if you want the story to hasten to its climax.


Event: The Lord of Storms
Sydon sends this storm to batter the Ultros after the
heroes have visited 1-2 islands in the Cerulean Gulf.




Storm clouds suddenly gather above your ship.
Lightning flashes overhead, followed by booming thunder. The thunder becomes a voice-the voice of Sydon.
"Heed my warning, mortals. Your quest is doomed.
Your weapons will fail you. Your gods will perish, and
your ship will shatter upon the rocks. Your cities will
drown, and your names will be forgotten. You seek to
challenge the Titans, but there is no power that can
stand against the Lord of Storms."




The winds pick up and the ocean waves grow choppy.
On the horizon, you can see dozens of white sails. It
seems that a fleet of ships is passing by, several miles
to the east. But these are not normal ships-the oars
are the size of tree trunks. They appear to be giant
warships, crewed by gygans and cyclopes. And they
seem to be headed directly for the City of Mytros.




Lightning flashes across the sky a dozen times, and the
wind turns into a howling gale. The sky darkens until
it seems that night has fallen. Sydon has summoned a
powerful hurricane to destroy the Ultros.
The storm worsens with every hour. After five hours
have passed, the storm will reach a crescendo, and any
ship in the area will be destroyed. Someone must pilot
the Ultros and escape the storm by making at least three
successful piloting checks as described below.
For each hour spent in the hurricane, whoever is
piloting the ship must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Survival) check to keep the ship righted. On a failure,
they must make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics)
check or be swept overboard. If someone is helping the
pilot, then both characters must make the check.



This is the invasion force that Sydon has been gathering to wipe the mortals from the face of Thylea. This is
immediately evident to Kyrah and Pythor.
The fleet consists of 30 ships, each crewed by 24
gygans, 1 gygan hero, 24 bronze automatons and 12
cyclopes. Each of the mighty ships is 200 feet long, has
a speed of 8 mph, AC 14, a damage threshhold of 15,
and 2,000 hit points. If the heroes are foolish enough to
attack the fleet, then one of the gygan heroes will blow
from a horn to summon 1-2 of Sydon's children (young
empyreans). The reinforcements will arrive within 10
rounds, flying on the backs of rocs.
Once Sydon himself has been defeated, this fleet will
lose its purpose. The bronze automatons will cease
working entirely, as they have no intelligence to guide
them. The gygans and cyclopes will return with their
ships to the Garden of Helios in the Forgotten Sea.
Event: Confronting Sydon
The heroes can confront Sydon by ascending to the
top of his tower in the Forgotten Sea. However, he will
likely escape to the city of Mytros, where the final battle
against the Titans takes place. Refer to the chapters
Praxys, Tower of Sydon and The Battle of Mytros.
Introduction

Lutheria, Lady of Dreams

This nightmare affects everyone, even races that do not
normally sleep, such as elves.
Each hero must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw
or be afflicted with a random short-term madness. Roll
on the short-term madness table in the Game Master's
Guide. Since there are no nearby enemies to take advantage of their vulnerability, this is simply an opportunity
for players to roleplay their madness.

Lutheria primarily takes action against the party by
sending monsters to attack them and nightmares to
haunt their dreams. Unlike her husband, she is more
focused on corrupting and subverting the party.
Event: Dreaming of Lutheria
After the heroes leave the Temple of the Oracle,
Lutheria sends a nightmare to haunt them. Whenever
they take a rest, read the following:




A woman's voice suddenly emanates from the darkness
around you. "So... your great 'quest' begins. Off to
become heroes, are you? Mortals are so very proud."
A light shines in the dark, illuminating the sad and
pathetic figure of an old man, who has been hogtied
to a stake. "Look at this one. He's falling to pieces:
joints stiff, skin slack, teeth gone. The life is practically
dripping out of him."
Inky black shadows fall across the old man. He
flinches and squirms, panicking as something draws
closer-something that you cannot see.
"Yes, his sad mortal life is leaking away. But I wonder
what will happen to his soul?"
The old man thrashes against his restraints, screaming into his gag as a butcher's knife descends, and you
awaken from the nightmare, bathed in sweat.


Event: Madness of Lutheria
Lutheria sends another nightmare after the heroes
complete their second Labor. Whenever they take a rest,
read the following:





22

Introduction



"Poor little mortals." The woman's voice is soft and
concerned. "So worried about everything! Worried
about honoring the gods; worried about offending
them. Worried about war. Worried about the future.
What can we do to make you worry less?"
On the path ahead, you see a man standing with his
back to you. He gazes out over a beautiful valley, which
is covered with wild flowers. A soft breeze is blowing,
and birds are singing brightly.
"Knowledge is the greatest of all mortal burdens,
don't you think? Knowledge is pain. Ignorance puts the
mind at ease. Ignorance makes mortals happy!"
The man turns. His face is twisted with pain and
despair. Red tears streak his face. His eyes, ears, and
mouth have all been stitched shut.


Everyone awakens from this nightmare at different
times. Each person who dreams must roll 1d10. This
determines how many rounds until they awaken. They
can be awakened early by shaking or inflicting damage
to them. Whenever a hero awakens they must make
a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with a
random long-term madness. Roll on the long-term madness table in the Game Master's Guide.
This is another opportunity for players to roleplay
their madness. The madness can be cured with a lesser
restoration spell.
Event: Corruption of Lutheria
This dream comes to the heroes when they are sailing
across the Cerulean Gulf. Read the following:




Lutheria's voice comes to you, soft as a sea breeze.
"Why do mortals feel the need to explore? To sail
over every horizon? What do you expect to find out
there in the vast emptiness of the oceans?"
Five men cling to the wreckage of a ship, drifting
towards a shoreline. As they draw closer, the relief on
their faces is palpable. Eventually, they splash through
the shallows and collapse on the white sand.
"These men once sought treasure, but now they seek
simple things: food and fresh water."
The sun slowly sets towards the wine-dark sea. The
men have set up camp, and the tantalizing smell of
roasting pork drifts from the fire.
"Perhaps you'd like to join them? Are you hungry?"
The men greedily chew the meat and gnaw at the
bones, juice and gristle dripping down their chins. You
notice that one of the men is missing now, and the
discarded bones look much too large for a pig.


Event: Summoned by the King
Once the heroes have completed the Great Labors, King
Acastus summons them to Mytros and gives them a
map to the Ultros. He hopes that his ghostly ancestor,
Estor Arkelander, will kill them. Refer to the Summoned
by the King chapter for details.
Event: The Voyage of the Ultros
The king is angry that the heroes have survived their
encounter with his ancestor. He will vehemently deny any
accusations that the heroes make. By this point, it should
be obvious that Acastus is an enemy of the heroes. Refer
to the Voyage of the Ultros chapter for details.
Event: The Battle of Mytros
Acastus tries to save the city from the Titans by unleashing his dragon, Icarus, with disastrous results. The
heroes must defeat Icarus and confront Acastus in the
colosseum where the Great Games are held.
The king's rod of rulership is the key that will activate
the Colossus of Pythor. He refuses to surrender it, and
he may fight to the death to protect his pride. Refer to
the Battle of Mytros chapter for details.

PLAYING THE GODS



Everyone wakes together. Each hero must make a DC 20
Wisdom saving throw or be consumed with bloodlust
for 1 minute. Those afflicted will do their best to reduce
every other hero in their group to an unconscious state.
This is a chance for players to fight each other, no
holds barred, without guilt or hard feelings.
Event: Confronting Lutheria
The heroes can confront Lutheria by descending to
her throne in the Nether Sea. Whatever happens to
Lutheria, she has ways of returning from the dead, and
she may show up in the story later.
Refer to The Nether Sea, The Battle of Mytros, and The
Apokalypsis chapters for details.

Unlike gods in other settings and adventures, the Five
Gods of Thylea are directly involved in the story and
often travel with the heroes in mortal guise. The gods
should never be allowed to overshadow the heroes.
While Kyrah will accompany the heroes from the start
of the story, she is only there to record their exploits.
She does not fight alongside them in battle. Pythor joins
the heroes on the Ultros, but his drunkenness renders
him mostly useless. Vallus and Volkan are allies, but
they never accompany the heroes on their journeys.
Refer to the Dramatis Personae appendix for more
details on how to roleplay each of the gods.
The Oath of Peace
Until the Oath of Peace comes to an end, the Five Gods
are forbidden from fighting Sydon, Lutheria, or their
allies. They can advise the heroes, but generally speaking,
they cannot assist the heroes in battle.

RUNNING THE EPIC PATHS

King Acastus of Mytros

This section describes how to integrate each of the epic
paths into the story. Every epic path includes a secret
divine boon that can be used to bring the hero back to
life. Before running any of the epic paths, you should read
through the Epic Paths in the Creating Heroes appendix.

King Acastus is jealous of the heroes and worries that
they will overshadow him. He has long sought to restore
the order of the Dragonlords, but rather than earning
his dragons, he's made secret pacts with the Titans.

Sharing Epic Paths
Epic paths are designed to give each player their own
unique motivations and moments in the spotlight. They
work best if they are not shared.
Introduction

23

However, if your players wish to share an epic path,
then the best way to accomplish this is to have them
create characters who are siblings or otherwise closely
related. They will effectively be playing as partners who
share the same story. In this case, they should each get
their own rewards, and you may want to differentiate
them by tailoring the items to their chosen classes.

The Demi-God
The Demi-god is a child of Pythor, the God of Battle.
Pythor has spent centuries obsessing over his failures.
He believes that the Demi-god is his path to redemption.
Pythor wants the Demi-god to perform the tasks that
he himself failed to accomplish-and to take his place as
the God of Battle.
Meeting the Oracle. Versi expects great things from
the Demi-god. She encourages them to travel to Estoria
and meet their father, Pythor.
Meeting Pythor. When the heroes first meet Pythor
in Estoria, he recognizes the Demi-god as one of his
children. He laments that the green dragon Hexia took
the Demi-god's mother from him. Hexia dwells somewhere in the Forgotten Sea.
Pythor's Hammer. When Pythor learns that the
Demi-god wants to finish building his greatest weapon,
he will offer up his magical hammer (Pythor's hammer).
Pythor will explain that the hammer will be needed
to forge the weapon. But first he makes the Demi-god
swear an oath to save his daughter Anora (the Demigod's half-sister) from being sacrificed to Sydon.
After giving the Demi-god his hammer, Pythor
suggests that the Demi-god talk with Volkan, his father,
who also dwells in Estoria.
Meeting Volkan. Volkan tells the Demi-god that they
will only be able to forge Pythor's unfinished weapon
using the Mithral Forge. He tells the Demi-god to relight
the Mithral Forge and find the components required to
complete Pythor's unfinished weapon.
Forging the Weapon. Once the fires of the Mithral
Forge are relit, Volkan can forge the unfinished weapon
when given the appropriate materials. When the
weapon is complete, Volkan sends a keledone to deliver
it to the Demi-god.
Pythor's Greatest Foe. The Demi-god eventually
discovers that their mother is a prisoner in Hexia's lair
on the Island of the Dragon. By defeating Hexia, the
Demi-god will defeat Pythor's greatest foe and rescue
their mother in one fell swoop.
The Demi-god's mother has some knowledge of the
Forgotten Sea and can give a vague description of each
island. She asks the Demi-god to succeed where her
husband failed and save Thylea from the Titans.

Divine Boon
If the Demi-God is ever killed, Pythor will appear within
1 hour and surrender a portion of his divine spark to raise
them back to life. This can only happen once, and Pythor
suffers one level of permanent exhaustion as a result.

The Vanished One
The Oracle, Versi, has lived for millennia and has never
loved anyone-until she laid eyes on the Vanished One.
She will do anything to ensure that the Vanished One
lives, but her jealousy knows no bounds.
Meeting the Oracle. Versi asks the Vanished One
to swear an oath that they will return to her once the
prophecy has been fulfilled and the world has been
saved from disaster. Once the oath is sworn, Versi will
reveal that the Vanished One's famed armor, along with
the crown of the Dragonlords, are located in the Tomb
of Xander at the Necropolis of Telamok. She refuses to
offer this information unless the oath is sworn.
Versi's Jealousy. Versi uses her divination magic to
watch over the Vanished One. She becomes very jealous if
anyone else shows romantic interest. If the Vanished One
ever consummates another romance, Versi confronts the
Vanished One one day later. She will try her best to kill
whoever was intimate with the Vanished One.
Speaking to Xander. The undead Xander at the
Necropolis of Telamok recognizes the Vanished One
and gives them a crown of the dragonlords. However,
their famed armor has been stolen by a man named
Gaius. Gaius is the commander of the Order of Sydon.
He keeps the Vanished One's fabled armor in his room
on the Island of Yonder.
Versi's Vision. When the heroes first set out in the
Ultros, Versi appears and tells the Vanished One where
to find one of the dragon eggs that are scattered across
Thylea. She has had a vision of a dragon egg under the
constellation of The Prisoner. This corresponds to the
brass dragon egg on Fire Island (area V15).
The Forgotten Dragon. If the heroes encounter
Hezzebal, the dragon guarding the Mirror Prison in the
Nether Sea, then the dragon blames the Vanished One
for his long imprisonment.
Divine Boon
If the Vanished One is ever killed, Versi will appear
within 1 hour and kiss them, which restores them to
life. This can only happen once.

The Doomed One
When the Doomed One was born, Lutheria demanded
that they be sacrificed along with many other children
as part of an annual wine festival. Of all the parents
of these children, only the Doomed One's refused.
Consequently, Lutheria slaughtered the Doomed One's
parents and directed her entire army of servants to torment the child endlessly as a practical joke.

Lutheria's Joke. While Lutheria lives, her servants
focus their attacks upon the Doomed One. This includes
goatlings, jackalwere, lamia, maenad, and all hostile
undead. It should be obvious to the Doomed One that
these creatures are singling them out.
Meeting the Oracle. The Oracle's corrupted sister,
Demetria, knows more about the fate that has been laid
upon the Doomed One. Versi explains that Demetria
can be found in the Mossy Temple.
Meeting Demetria. Demetria recognizes the Doomed
One. She reveals that the Doomed One is destined to die
by the workings of Lutheria. She says that only the Fates
can say more. This may also be revealed in the dream
when the heroes drink from the Horn of Balmytria.
Consulting the Fates. The Fates (pg. 140) reveal the
full prophecy that accompanied the Doomed One's
birth. They were to suffer all their life and die three
times to satisfy the Queen of Death. The Fates also
reveal the full story of the Doomed One's birth parents-and the cruelty of Lutheria's practical joke.
The Fates' Loom. The Fates possess a magical loom
that can be used to forge an item capable of protecting
against Lutheria. This requires the Doomed One to
either kill the Fates or bargain with them.
Confronting Lutheria. When the Doomed One
confronts Lutheria on her throne in the Nether Sea,
the Titan will take no actions for one round as she is
consumed by uncontrollable laughter. She fondly recalls
all of the pointless suffering that she has inflicted upon
the Doomed One.
Divine Boon
If the Doomed One is killed, they will immediately come
under the effects of the spell true resurrection. This can
happen only twice. No matter how the Doomed One
is raised from the dead, they will remain dead forever
after dying for the third time. This restriction ends once
Lutheria is dead.

The Haunted One
No one believes that the Haunted One's family ever
existed-not even the gods. Only the Fates know the
truth. The Haunted One was foretold to "break the
power of death." When Lutheria learned this, she hunted
them down and slaughtered their entire family.
But Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn, intervened.
Before Lutheria could strike the killing blow against the
Haunted One, Mytros reached out with divine magic
and erased the Haunted One's entire existence from
memory. Lutheria forgot her purpose and returned to
her throne.
None but the Fates remember the prophecy or the
existence of the Haunted One and her family. Mytros
saw that the prophecy could only come true if all trace
of the Haunted One's history were forgotten. The souls
of their family remain trapped in Lutheria's scythe.

Meeting the Oracle. Versi tells the Haunted One
that their corrupted sister, Demetria, possesses one of
her lost family artifacts. Demetria can be found in the
Mossy Temple in the Old Woods.
Defeating Demetria. Demetria possesses one of the
Haunted One's lesser family artifacts. It was stolen and
carried to the temple by one of her goatling servants.
Attuning the Artifact. When the Haunted One
attunes the lesser artifact, they hear whispers of their
family's voices. The voice of the person they loved most
in life (mother, father, spouse, child, etc.) will be loudest.
That voice tells them that the other family artifact is
held by the Queen of the Amazons.
The Amazon Queen. The greater family artifact is
indeed in the possession of the Amazon Queen on the
Island of Themis. When the Haunted One attunes to the
greater artifact, the whispers from their family become
louder. The loved relative will tell the Haunted One that
the Fates know the truth.
Consulting the Fates. The Fates reveal the Haunted
One's full backstory, including the prophecy and the fact
that Mytros erased their family from all memory. The
Fates say that only by breaking Lutheria's crystal scythe
can the Haunted One free their family's souls.
Confronting Lutheria. If the Haunted One confronts Lutheria directly on her throne in Hypnos, then
Lutheria will vaguely recall the prophecy and realize that
she's made a mistake. She will direct all of her efforts at
killing the Haunted One before anyone else.
Destroying the Scythe. Destroying Lutheria's crystal
scythe releases the souls of the Haunted One's family so
that they may pass on to the afterlife. Remembrance and
knowledge of their existence also returns to the world.
Divine Boon
Once attuned to a family artifact, the Haunted One can
escape death once. If the Haunted One is killed, the spirits of their loved ones will possess the hero so that they
can continue their battle as if they had just taken a short
rest. This can only happen once.

The Gifted One
The Gifted One is a grandchild of Sydon, who fell in love
with a mortal sorceress decades ago. Lutheria eventually
convinced her brother that such a romance was corrupting him. Sydon murdered the sorceress, not knowing
that she had already given birth to a daughter; the Gifted
One is a child of that daughter.
Meeting the Oracle. Versi reveals the Gifted One's
conflicted ancestry, explaining that Sydon murdered
their sorceress grandmother. She gives the Gifted One a
locket that once belonged to her.
The Whispering Locket. One week after receiving the
locket, the spirit of the Gifted One's grandmother will
speak through it. She will whisper to the Gifted One that
they are to resurrect the Dragonlords of old. But they
must first exact vengeance upon Sydon.
Introduction

25

The Wisdom of Vallus. Before the heroes set sail in
the Ultros, Vallus offers the Gifted One her counsel. She
believes that the Gifted One will restore glory to the
order of the Dragonlords. But first, they must recover
the fortress of the Dragonlords. It can be found in the
possession of a dragon in the Garden of Helios.
Dragon Eggs. The Gifted One can find a dragon egg
in several places throughout the world of Thylea.
Fortress of the Dragonlords. The instant fortress can
be found in the treasure hoard of the gold dragon that
rules the Garden of Helios. When summoned, it manifests as a tower with draconic architectural motifs.
The Silver Dragon. When the Gifted One meets
Nephele, the silver dragon at Praxys, their grandmother
will speak to them through the locket. She will reveal
that the silver dragon is without a soul. If the Gifted One
breaks the locket, her soul can enter the dragon.
In this case, the Gifted One gains an adult silver
dragon as an ally. However, the dragon is as arrogant
and mercurial as the sorceress was in life. She will only
assist with the battle against Sydon.
Confronting Sydon. When the Gifted One confronts
Sydon, he is disappointed that one of his progeny could
be so small and weak.
Divine Boon
If the Gifted One is ever killed, their body will disintegrate. Vallus will then use a true resurrection spell
to bring them back to life. She then uses her magic to
return the Gifted One to their companions. This can
only happen once.

The Lost One
The Lost One is a hero who came from the outer world
as a survivor of a shipwreck or as an explorer seeking
fame and fortune. Unlike the other epic paths, this
works well if more than one player decides to create a
character with this path. If more than one player creates
a character with this path, then their rewards should be
added to the lost treasure of the Dragonlords.
Meeting the Oracle. Versi believes that the Lost One
will find a way home, but first they must find the lost
treasure of the Dragonlords.
Meeting Pythor. When Pythor meets the Lost One,
the god will offer to tell what he knows of the lost
treasure of the Dragonlords, but only if his daughter
is rescued before being sacrificed to Sydon. When his
daughter is safe, Pythor reveals that Estor Arkelander
was the last in possession of the treasure. Estor is now
the undead captain of the ghost ship, the Ultros.
Estor's Bargain. Once the heroes have gained control
of the Ultros, Estor Arkelander will reveal to the Lost
One that he buried the treasure of the Dragonlords
in the Nether Sea. The treasure is sealed in a massive
prison meant to contain a creature used by the gods as a
weapon at the dawn of time. Estor will guide the heroes

Introduction

to it, but only if the Lost One swears an oath to allow
him first pick of the treasure hoard-there is a single
item that he wants above all else.
The Wisdom of Vallus. When Vallus gives the
Antikythera device to the heroes, she explains that it
can be modified. A skilled gygan smith can rework it so
that it can reveal a path through the Forgotten Sea to the
world beyond. This work can be done by one of several
gygan smiths - Steros, Bront, or Garzoon.
The Dragonlords' Treasure. The lost treasure of the
Dragonlords is sealed in the broken 'mirror' prison that
was used to imprison the Kraken in the Nether Sea. The
heroes must defeat the corrupted dragon that guards the
treasure. Afterwards, if the Lost One swore the oath to
Estor, the ghost takes the xiphos of slaughter from the
treasure hoard.
Divine Boon
Once the Ultros has been claimed, if the Lost One is
killed, then Estor will appear and possess the body of the
Lost One, bringing them back to full health and powers
as if they had just completed a full rest. The player can
play as the possessed hero and try to extricate themselves from the situation where they were defeated. This
can only happen once.

The Dragonslayer
The dragon responsible for the tragedy that destroyed
the Dragonslayer's childhood home is the gold dragon
known as Helios.
Meeting the Oracle. Versi tells the Dragonslayer that
they are destined to become the bane of evil dragons.
They must seek out the Forgekeeper in the Mithral
Mines to learn more about the artifacts they need.
The Mithral Forge. The Forgekeeper will give the
Dragonslayer their lesser magic item. The Forgekeeper
says that the Dragonslayer must obtain a weapon powerful enough to fight a dragon. The gygans of Yonder
supposedly forged such weapons in the First War.
Consulting the Fates. The Fates reveal that the
Dragonslayer should seek the wisdom of the Sun God
under the constellation of The Chariot. He will help the
Dragonslayer find the revenge that they seek.
The Forbidden Library. The Dragonslayer's greater
magic item can be found in the possession of Chondrus
on the Island of Yonder. He will offer it willingly if the
players agree to his bargain.
Confronting Helios. If the Dragonslayer arrives
at the Garden of Helios, the Sun God will focus all
of his attention on them. During dinner with Helios
the Sun God will reveal that he has been waiting for
the Dragonslayer's arrival for a long time. The Fates
told him that he would be killed by someone in the
Dragonslayer's family/town/tribe, so he rained fire down
upon their home long ago. Once Helios assumes his
dragon form, he attempts to devour the Dragonslayer.

Confronting Talieus. In the Great Arena at the Tower
of Sydon, Talieus and his audience will focus their ridicule on the Dragonslayer, and the dragons will prioritize
attacking the Dragonslayer.
Divine Boon
If the Dragonslayer is ever killed, they will be visited by
Morta (the night hag) from the Island of the Fates. She
will raise the Dragonslayer from the dead and reveal that
their fate is not to die here. This can only happen once.

The Cursed One
The curse that afflicts the Cursed One's family originates on Typhon Island. Only by going to the island and
diving into its central vortex can the Cursed One end
the curse.
Meeting the Oracle. Versi tells the Cursed One that
they must speak with Damon, the ancient lich who
guards the Necropolis at Telamok, to learn more about
the nature of their curse.
Meeting Damon. Damon knew the Cursed One's
ancestor. He says that the curse is unlike any other in
Thylea, and that it was devised by Sydon and Lutheria.
He says that the Cursed One must seek out the Lotus
Witch on Scorpion Island. She will know how to break
the curse. Damon gives the Cursed One a lost family
heirloom-a gem of brightness.
Meeting the Lotus Witch. The Lotus Witch reveals
that the magic of the curse originates on Typhon island.
Only by going there and diving into its volcanic heart
will the Cursed One be granted their wish. But to do
so they must possess a magic item powerful enough to
protect against a fiery death.
The Greater Artifact. The Lotus Witch will only give
the Cursed One the artifact that they need if they are
able to answer enough of her riddles. Otherwise the
Cursed One must kill the Lotus Witch.
Typhon Island. When the Cursed One reaches
Typhon Island, they can leap into the volcanic core. If
they have the artifact from the Lotus Witch, they will
appear on the ash plains of Hades unharmed. There
the Cursed One will find an old man (NE commoner)
guarded by a cerberus hound.
The Cursed Ancestor. The old man is the Cursed
One's ancestor, and the curse was his fault. He disrespected the Titans, and this was his punishment. The
cerberus says that killing the old man is the only way to
end the curse. The old man does not defend himself.
Ending the Curse. If the Cursed One kills their ancestor, the cerberus devours the corpse, and all curses on
all of the Cursed One's family members come to an end.
The Cursed One awakens back on Typhon Island.
Killing the Titans. If both Sydon and Lutheria are
killed, then the curse is lifted and the Cursed One's
ancestor is released from Hades. Their gem of brightness
is also fully recharged. However, this solution is never
offered or explained-it must be discovered.

Divine Boon
If the Cursed One is ever killed, Damon will teleport in
and destroy any remaining enemies. The lich will then
hand a raise dead scroll to one of the Cursed One's companions before leaving. This can only happen once.

CREATING EPIC PATHS

Your players may wish to create an epic path that isn't
offered in Odyssey of the Dragonlords. This section
explains how to create one. It is important for an epic
path to feel personal to a player, so you should involve
the player in the creation process.
Epic paths should never give heroes special items or
powers at character creation. That is the function of
classes and backgrounds.

Make them Epic
Epic paths must live up to the name. They must be epic.
The story and goals should be heroic enough to work
for the protagonist of a great fantasy novel or summer
blockbuster movie. For example:

• The abandoned child of a god or king who is destined
to overthrow their tyrannical parent.

• A hero who is fated to unify a kingdom that has long
been sundered by civil war.

• A hero who is fated to prevent a looming disaster of
cataclysmic proportions.

• A hero who is fated to be the savior of their tribe, their
home city, or their entire race.

• A hero who is driven to resurrect an ancient order
(religion, army, fleet, cult, etc.).

• A hero who is destined to discover a legendary
treasure/secret/monster.

Synergy with the campaign
Epic paths should involve locations and characters that
are already central to the story of this campaign. Epic
paths should always drive the heroes to complete the
campaign's primary objectives, or else they risk derailing
the campaign. Give them reasons to meet the Five Gods,
explore the oceans, and confront the Titans.

Freedom of Choice
Epic paths must allow the player freedom to choose how
they will proceed in the story. They should never force
the hero into taking certain actions that might be out of
character. They should have well-defined goals, but you
should never undermine the player's freedom to choose
how they will accomplish those goals.

Heroic Tasks
An epic path needs tasks to drive the hero onwards.
Several heroic tasks for the hero should revolve around
obtaining magic items, special powers, or the services
of a powerful companion or mount. Heroic tasks should

should never distract from the main storyline.
Below are guidelines for the power levels of the
rewards earned for completing heroic tasks:

• Single Magic Item: Very Rare. This item shouldn't be

available until the hero is 10th level or higher.
• Two Magic Items: 2x Rare. One item should be available at 5th level of higher, while the other item should
be available at 8th level or higher.
• Special Powers: Equivalent to one of the Epic Boons
in the Game Master's Guide. This boon shouldn't be
available until the hero is at least 8th level.
• Mount/Companion: CR 3 or lower. This shouldn't be
available until the hero is at least 7th level.

Divine Blessing
The divine blessing is awarded to a hero when they
accomplish all of their heroic tasks. This is a tool to
encourage players to complete their heroic tasks, even
those that don't immediately lead to power gains.
The 5th Edition Game Master's Guide blessings
should be used as a guideline for this reward.

Divine Boon
The divine boon is a 'get out of jail free card' that brings
the hero back to life when they are killed. This allows for
the possibility of some truly terrifying encounters where
the destruction of the entire party is a real possibility.
Divine boons usually only activate once for each hero.
They should take the form of a key character from the
epic path's backstory, or a major character from the plot.

CHARACTER
ADVANCEMENT

You may use standard XP awards for defeating monsters and other challenges. Experience points should be
distributed to the heroes at the end of every session. You
can also give out XP rewards for completing major story
milestones. This is optional, but it provides a strong
incentive for your party to stay engaged with the story.
28

Introduction

Above is a breakdown of the ideal hero levels at different points in this adventure. It also shows suitable XP
awards for accomplishing major story objectives.

ADJUSTING THE
CAMPAIGN
Other Campaign Settings
Thylea is designed to easily fit into any campaign world.
As the 'forgotten continent,' it can be located across the
far reaches of the oceans in an existing setting. However,
this part of the world is so remote that it might be
treated as another plane of existence.
For example, magic sometimes works differently in
Thylea. Oaths that are binding in Thylea might cease to
be enforced beyond the borders of this land.
The gods of other campaign settings may suspect that
Thylea exists, but none of them dare venture into the
sacred domain of the Mother Goddess or her husband
Kentimane. Communication with the gods of the Old
World is possible through the use of spells such as
guidance and commune, but their influence on Thylea is
extremely limited.
You should decide where the Dragonlords and settlers
originally came from in your game world. All that is
known for certain is that they came from a distant land
with dragons and humans.
You can also use Thylea as a self-contained setting. Anything could exist beyond the horizon of the
Forgotten Sea, so you feel free to expand the world with
your own islands and continents!

Starting at 5th level
Some groups might be using pre-existing characters at
a higher level when they start the adventure. The best
way to deal with these high-level groups is to skip two
of the three Great Labors in the first act. In this case,
the Oracle might provide the heroes with the Horn of
Balmytria, and Volkan might lead the heroes to the
Mithral Forge.

Smaller Parties and Followers

Customizing the Story

If you are running this campaign with a smaller group of
players, you should consider allowing some of the minor
NPCs to join the party as player-controlled followers as
the party encounters them in the story.
Be judicious in distributing additional power in this
way-the party size should not exceed six characters, or
else encounters will start to be trivialized. Likewise, you
don't want combat to turn into a slog.
The following NPCs are intended to be used for this
purpose: Loreus, Bullbug, Darien, Moxena, Nessa,
Pholon, and Steros. The Oracle and the Five Gods
should not be controlled by players.

The story presented in this book is just a tool that we've
designed to make the campaign easier for you to run.
You should feel free to customize the story to your
liking-or even just let your players loose on the world
with less guidance than we've provided.
If you'd like to create your own story in the world of
Thylea, then we suggest starting by choosing a strong
villain. The villain might be a servant of one of the
Titans, a forgotten Dragonlord, or legendary warlord
who seeks to become a god. Whatever the case, we
strongly encourage that you take advantage of the Epic
Paths to raise the stakes and make it feel personal.

Thylean Script
This form of writing is used across the kingdoms of Aresia, Mytros, and Estoria. It is believed to date back to the
Gygan Empire, as it was already the predominant mode of writing when the first human settlers arrived.


Chapter 1:

Heroes of the Prophecy
"No, husband, the mortals no longer heed
your storms. Let us instead send a great beast to
defile the lands they stole from us. I am sure that
they will appreciate the irony."

S

-Lutheria, the Lady of Dreams

ydon and Lutheria, the Twin Titans, have
corrupted the heart of an ancient boar and
unleashed it in the verdant countryside east of
the City of Estoria. They hope to create fear in
the people of Thylea so that the mortals will abandon
their worship of the Five Gods. The Oath of Peace once
protected the human settlers from the Titans, but now
the magic of the oath is weakening. This is a small taste
of the devastation to come.

Kyrah has summoned the heroes to hunt the boar and
put an end to the devastation that it is causing. Once the
beast has been slain, the carcass should be burned as a
sacrifice to one of the gods or Titans. Great fame and
riches are promised to those who make such offerings.
The Order of Sydon has demanded that the boar be an
offering to Sydon, the Lord of Storms, but everyone in
the world knows that such offerings can alter the balance of power among the gods.


We gods can only do so much to keep the peace,
especially when the priests abandon our temples.
In these dark times, it is we who must have faith
in mortals, rather than the other way around.
- Kyrah, Goddess of Music
30



The future of Thylea looks grim. Monsters menace
the roads, and corruption threatens the cities. The
storm god Sydon demands daily sacrifices at every
temple, and his sister-wife Lutheria kidnaps children for her secret rituals. The Five Gods, who once
protected the settlers, are silent. And now, the Oracle
has prophesied the Doom of Thylea: the death of
gods, the destruction of Mytros, and the total annihilation of the mortal races.
You are one of a group of warriors who have been
summoned to the Heartlands in an attempt to avert
this coming catastrophe. You each have reasons for
answering the call, but rumors of your coming have
already spread across the land.

The Sour Vintage




Kyrah
the Poet

The Sour Vintage is a traditional country inn located at
a crossroads, about twenty miles east of the City of
Estoria. The exterior is rustic wood painted black, and
the sign hanging from the door depicts a woman carrying a basket full of grapes. Inside the tavern, a haze of
pleasant tobacco smoke lingers in the air. You hear the
clinking of mugs and the muttering of patrons, most of
whom are farmers.
You have been summoned here by a woman named
Kyrah who wants to hire you for a 'difficult task'. She
has promised a sizable reward, and more information
about the Oracle's prophecy.




The Poet from Mytros
Kyrah (see appendix) has been sent by Versi the Oracle,
but she is using the identity of a poet, one of some skill
and renown. It is Kyrah's task to gather the heroes from
the oracle's vision and ensure that they live up to their
potential. Kyrah knows all of the rumors that have been
circulating about the heroes, and she takes a moment to
recognize their unique talents.




A dark-haired woman calls you over to a table in the
corner. She wears a white traveling dress with practical leather boots, and she carries a large satchel that
appears to contain dozens of scrolls, along with plentiful writing supplies.
"Greetings, I am Kyrah. Thank you for answering my
summons. I will be direct. I am here as an agent of the
Oracle. She believes that great destinies await you all,
but great destinies are forged by great deeds.
"A terrifying giant boar has been laying waste to the
Heartlands, slaughtering everything in its path. This boar
was corrupted by the Titans and sent to punish the mortals of Thylea for their continued faith in the Five Gods.
Many have attempted to hunt the boar. All have failed.
"If you wish to win fame and fortune, as great heroes
should, then you must prove to the people of Thylea
that you are the warriors of the Oracle's prophecy.
Hunt this boar and offer it to the gods as a sacrifice."


Kyrah's Identity
Kyrah is actually the goddess of music and makes little
effort to disguise her identity, but she behaves like any
other mortal woman. If anyone suggests that she might
be more than she lets on, she feigns innocence and
changes the subject. The locals recognize her as a poet
from Mytros, but most will assume that she has merely
been blessed with the appearance of the goddess.

The poet offers the heroes assistance in accomplishing
this task. She has hired two hunters who can help track
down the corrupted boar. They will be waiting outside
of the tavern an hour before dawn. She also offers the
heroes a reward for slaying the beast: a golden arrow
per hero worth 25 gp each. She will give the reward to
the heroes once the Oracle is satisfied that they are the
heroes from her vision.


Kyrah explains that the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria, have
always hated the mortals of Thylea. For five hundred
years, their hatred has been shackled by the Oath of
Peace. Now, the power of the Oath has waned, and this
ancient beast is one of many signs that they are plotting
war upon Mytros once again.

Staying the Night
The heroes can spend the rest of the night drinking
and speaking to the locals. This is a good opportunity
for the heroes to learn about each other, as well as hear
of any recent events and rumors. Kyrah is willing to
answer any questions they may have about Thylea. The
heroes may also purchase basic supplies from Aetala,
the innkeeper.

Spreading Rumors
If your players have prepared rumors about themselves,
now is a good time to distribute them around the table.
This is an opportunity for your players to roleplay their
characters and get to know each other better.

The Innkeeper
The innkeeper is a retired hunter named Aetala (NG
veteran). She knows the Heartlands better than most,
and she has all the rumors from Estoria. She recognizes
at least one of the heroes, and she suggests that they
hunt the boar. Aetala made her fortune hunting a similar
beast decades ago.

Injured Hunting Party
These hunters are recovering from minor injuries
sustained while hunting the boar. They set a trap for
the beast by laying twenty pounds of rotten fruit in the
middle of a field and hiding in the surrounding hedges.
The boar took them by surprise. It gored one of their
friends with its tusks and dragged him into the woods.
They tried to follow but the sounds were too horrible,
and so they came here to drink to the memory of their
dead friend.

Forlorn Farmers
Most of the other patrons in the tavern are farmers
who are too frightened to tend their fields. Their
families are holed up inside farmhouse basements, or
else they've fled to the safety of Estoria until the beast
has been killed. If any of the farmers recognize the
heroes, they become angry with them: why aren't they
out hunting the boar? What else are heroes good for,
anyway?

Hunting the Boar
Kyrah and the two hunters are waiting outside the
tavern an hour before dawn. The hunters are named
Taneias and Javon (LG scouts). The morning is cold and
foggy, and the ground is wet with dew. The hunters lead
the party away from the tavern and deep into the hills to
the north. The party passes many farms and settlements
that have been destroyed by the corrupted boar.




As you make your way northward into the Heartlands,
you pass many ravaged farms and settlements, all
attacked by the boar. The rocks and trees along the
road have been gouged by its tusks, leaving deep,
ragged trenches. Carrion crows flock in the fields,
picking at the bodies of failed hunters and unfortunate settlers.




The party should make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival)
check to attempt to track the corrupted boar. A failure means the heroes spend an entire day in fruitless
searching. You may choose to run one random plains
encounter during the hunt, whether or not they succeed on this check.
Kyrah will not fight in any of the heroes' battles. She will
stay away from enemies and make meticulous notes for
an epic poem about the struggle. She will, however, do
her best to help the heroes by keeping their spirits up.
If the heroes appear to be in grave danger, she may sing
one of her songs to lend aid. If a hero dies, she will wait
until the danger has passed and then use her raise dead
scrolls to bring them back to life, invoking the power of
Mytros, the goddess, to do so.

THE BOAR'S CAVE

• Rope Snare. This trap requires 50 ft. of rope. It will

entangle the boar's legs, cutting its movement speed
in half and preventing it from using any charge abilities. Setting it requires a Survival DC 12 skill check.
• Spiked Pitfall. This trap requires someone to dig a
hole 10 ft. deep and fill it with sharpened wooden
stakes. If the boar fails to leap over it, it will take 3d6
piercing damage and become immobilized. Digging
the pitfall requires Survival DC 20 skill check.
• Spiked Barricade. This trap requires setting up a row
of sharpened stakes, angled toward the cave mouth.
If the boar runs into the barricade, it will take 2d6
piercing damage. Constructing the barrier requires a
Survival DC 12 skill check.
At this point, have the party make DC 16 Wisdom
(Perception) checks. Anyone who fails to make the
check is surprised during the following battle. One of
the hunters is killed as soon as the boar appears:




Suddenly, you hear a bestial grunt from inside the cave.
A massive boar suddenly charges from the cave mouth,
goring one of the hunters on its tusks! Tossing the body
away like a ragdoll, the creature draws itself up to its
full height. It's an ancient white boar with fierce red
eyes and bloodied yellow tusks.


Eventually, the party stumbles upon a cave in the hills
where the boar has dragged its most recent kills. The
boar is inside the cave, messily devouring a couple of
unfortunate scouts.


From this height, you can see miles of mountainous
hills to the west. A thick blanket of fog hangs over the
lower land, and you can hear a gentle chorus of birds
greeting the morning sun. Eventually, you pick up the
boar's trail: another path of wanton destruction, split
tree trunks, and splatters of blood. The trail ends at
the shadowy mouth of a cave. Ear-splitting grunts and
squeals echo from inside.


The party may choose to set a variety of traps for the
boar. Each trap requires a successful Wisdom (Survival)
skill check to assemble. Failing the check causes someone to stumble and make a loud noise, at which the boar
becomes alerted to the party's presence. Possibilities for
traps include:

Encounter: The Boar Attacks

Kyrah's Assistance



Setting Traps



The great boar has several spears and arrows lodged
in its back, all the result of failed attempts to kill it. The
boar is bleeding from these wounds, causing it to suffer
one level of exhaustion at the end of each of its turns
in combat. Sensing that it is surrounded, it will try to
attack each hero at least once.

Death of the Boar



The boar fights until it is reduced to 0 hit points; at
this point it can be captured with a net and bound
with ropes. Once captured, the boar locks eyes with
the heroes and speaks its dying words directly into
their minds. Everyone hears its booming voice inside
their heads:

"Know this, mortals. Your sins cannot be atoned. An
ancient power sleeps in the heart of Thylea, and when
it awakens, the age of Mytros will come to an end.

all mortal things will come to death and darkness. No
prophecy will save you."

or Lutheria, as such an act will only strengthen their
dominion over the lands of Thylea.

Kyrah confesses her identity. She swears
an oath of protection to the heroes.

Pythor

Pythor swears an oath of service to the
heroes upon meeting them.

Vallus

Vallus grants the heroes a scarab of protection upon meeting them.

None

Hurricanes and earthquakes. The heroes
are transformed into goats for one day.



The boar's cave is only 50 ft. deep, and it's full of stinking water, gore, and boar dung. If the heroes decide to
wade into the disgusting mess in the cave and explore,
there is some treasure to be found.
Treasure
The two shredded corpses inside the cave may be
searched. Between them, they have 25 gp and 37 sp. One
of them carried a silvered spear. Kyrah points out that
it is customary to bury or burn the dead, and that each
body should have two gold pieces placed on its eyes, the
expected payment for the Ferryman.

Sacrifice to the Gods
Once everyone has drawn breath and tended their
wounds, Kyrah reminds everyone that the dying boar
should be offered as a sacrifice to the gods. This is the
way of things in Thylea, and it will be a great offense to
both the gods and the people of Mytros if the beast does
not die as a proper offering. Whichever god receives this
sacrifice will grow in power as a result.
The heroes should collect wood to construct a sacrificial bier around the beast. Then, they must decide
which god will receive the sacrifice. Kyrah will remind
the heroes that the Order of Sydon demanded that the
boar be sacrificed to the Lord of Storms. She strongly

The chosen Ones
Whatever happens, the boar-slaying heroes are now
celebrated as the Oracle's Chosen Ones. The people of
Thylea will expect them to travel to the Temple of the
Oracle and discover what great destiny awaits them.

Temple of the Oracle
"Never trust the words of that witch,
Versi. She once claimed that she saw no great
deeds in my future, but look now-am I not the
King of Mytros?"



Though others failed, you slew the corrupted boar
that plagued the lands west of Mytros. Your names are
everywhere celebrated as the Heroes of the Heartlands.
Now, you have come to the Temple of the Oracle to
claim your reward.
Kyrah has promised that you will learn more of your
destiny from the water nymph, Versi, the legendary
Oracle who brokered the Oath of Peace. She is the
daughter of Sydon, the Lord of Storms, but she has
always been an ally to the mortals of Thylea.
But Kyrah has heard nothing from her in two weeks,
and now she fears that something may have happened
to the Oracle.

-King Acastus, on the Oracle of Thylea
The Temple of the Oracle is the fabled home of Versi,
an ancient naiad, a water nymph, with the gift of
prophecy. She has recently issued a dire warning to the
people of Mytros-the Doom of Thylea is nigh, and
only the great heroes from her vision can rescue the
land from total destruction.

O2. The Temple Portico




This massive temple has been built directly into the
wall of the canyon. Towering columns support a
pediment that is carved from the rocky cliff-face. A
marble frieze of Sydon sits enthroned above the center
columns, his black glaive in one hand.
Standing at the center of the portico are four men
clad in bronze mail and bright blue cloaks.


The Current Situation

Braeca has posted four soldiers here. The soldiers have
been told to expect a band of dangerous warriors and,
consequently, their nerves are somewhat on edge. They
will not immediately abandon their post, but they are
easy to intimidate. They will eventually flee into the
temple unless the heroes corner them or otherwise goad
them into a fight.

The Oracle, Versi (see appendix), has been trapped in
a cave below the temple for two weeks. After learning
of Versi's most recent prophecy, the Lord of Storms
decided to punish his daughter for her insubordination. Sydon sent a sea hag named Heleka to bring
Versi back to his tower in the Forgotten Sea. Like all
hags, Heleka is utterly evil. She is taking immense
pleasure from tormenting the naiad, but Sydon has
forbidden her from physically harming Versi.
Meanwhile, Gaius, the Commander of the Order of
Sydon, has learned that the heroes have come to meet
with the Oracle. He has personally ordered a detachment of soldiers to kill the heroes before they can even
have a chance to become famous enough to challenge
the powers that rule Thylea. The soldiers are led by a
priest named Braeca (LE acolyte), and they have been
ordered to kill the heroes on sight.

O3. The Temple Chamber




O1. Boiling Geysers


The Temple of the Oracle is located in a cleft in the
earth, many leagues from the nearest settlement. As
you descend into the chasm, the forest disappears,
replaced by steep walls of craggy rock. Warm vapors
rise from cracks and vents along the floor of the chasm,
filling the air with an eerie mist. You feel yourselves
sweating from the heat and exertion.


While crossing through the chasm, the heroes may
accidentally stumble across geysers of boiling steam
that suddenly shoot up. Each time the heroes move in
the rocky area of this chasm, they must make a DC 14
Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are blasted by
scalding steam and take 2d6 fire damage.
Minions of Heleka
There are four steam mephits in the chasm. They were
summoned by Heleka and ordered to prevent anyone
from getting close to the Temple. The mephits will
attempt to lure heroes to cross the boiling geysers.

Ch apter 1 - Heroes of the Prophec y



The inner chamber of the temple is dominated by
a massive bronze statue of Sydon, who sits upon a
throne at the rear of the cella. At the foot of the statue
is a rectangular pool, which reflects the light of four
large braziers into rippling patterns on the ceiling.
Five men clad in bronze mail and bright blue cloaks
are gathered around the sacrificial bier. They appear to
have taken the temple attendants hostage. One of the
hostages is shouting at the soldiers.

KEY LOCATIONS






Braeca is waiting inside the temple with another four
soldiers. He is holding Proteus (LG acolyte) and
three temple attendants (LG commoners) captive, but
he does not intend to harm them. However, the dead
bodies of several more temple attendants are strewn
about the temple in a bloody mess.
Proteus is the elder attendant of this temple, and he is
loudly and forcefully pleading with Braeca to stop "the
witch" from harming Versi. If questioned, he explains
that a sea hag named Heleka arrived at the temple two
weeks ago. She has been wantonly slaughtering his acolytes in order to torment the captive Oracle.
Sacrificial Bier. There is a bronze bier in the room
where sacrificial offerings are usually made by the
priests. Animal bones are scattered among the ashes.
Treasure. Braeca and his men are carrying 25 gp and
100 sp. Braeca carries a bronze symbol of Sydon, which
depicts the wrathful visage of the Lord of Storms.

O4. Locked Stairway Door
The stairway door that leads to the temple basement is
locked. The key to the door is located in the Attendants'
Chambers (O5). The door can be smashed open with a
successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.



O5. The Attendants' Chambers
These seven rooms are where the temple attendants
sleep. All of the rooms are sparse and tidy. Heleka
enchanted four flying swords and left them hanging
on the wall next to the key to the locked stairway door
(O4). The swords remain motionless until the key is
touched, at which point they come alive and attack.
Treasure. The priests keep no material wealth. They
have extra robes, boots, and scrolls inscribed with
prayers to the gods. Proteus's room is the one exception.
He has a small chest that contains six potions of healing.

O6. Mimic Door
The door at the bottom of the stairway is a mimic loyal
to Heleka. It looks like a strong oak door with Sydon's
face carved into it. When someone touches it, the mimic
will attack, with the 'carved' face of Sydon biting whoever touched it.

O7. The Oracle's Grotto




Liquid blue light shimmers and refracts across the slick
walls of this rocky grotto. The room is lit by torches and
filled with the vaporous mist of steaming hot springs.
You can hear water cascading into an underground river
at the rear of the cave.




Versi has lived in the waters of this cave for centuries,
attended by the faithful acolytes who serve her Temple.
She spends her days on the rock in the center of the
cave, inhaling the vapors of the hot spring and listening
to her dreams for new prophecies. Her visions have
always come true, and she is therefore greatly feared
and admired by the people of Thylea. This cave and the
resting chamber beyond it should be considered her lair.
One of the rugs in the center of this grotto is
actually a rug of smothering. It will attack anyone

who tries to move deeper into the cave. Heleka is in
the Oracle's resting chamber, where she is torturing
one of the temple attendants in order to torment the
Oracle herself.

O8. The Oracle's Chamber




At the entrance to this chamber, a beautiful woman
in golden raiment is stretched out above the underground river, held captive by tendrils of animated
water. In the chamber behind her, a hideous, blueskinned woman cackles as she plunges a knife into a
terrified acolyte.


completely fixated on holding the Oracle, and it will not
retaliate when attacked.
Once Heleka has finished tormenting Versi, she plans
to drag the Oracle into the depths of the cave and search
for an exit to the ocean.
Treasure. Heleka carries a single pearl worth 100 gp.
She also has a note that reads:




Heleka... I bid you now make good upon the oath of
service that once you swore me. You know the secret ways
through the Forgotten Sea to the cave where my daughter dwells. Find her and bring her to Praxys unharmed,
and I will release you from your oath.
- Sydon, Lord of All




Versi is furious with Heleka for slaughtering her temple
attendants, who were like children to her. She would kill
the hag if she could, but she has been restrained in her
resting chamber by a water weird. The water weird is
38

Ch apter 1 - Heroes of the Prophec y

The Oracle's Belongings. In addition to what can be
found on Heleka, many of the gifts that the Oracle has
received over the years are found here. These include:



THE GREAT LABORS

five black pearl gems worth 500 gp each, three emerald
gems worth 1000 gp each, and six fine brooches worth
750 gp each. Taking any of the Oracle's gifts marks the
thief as cursed by the gods. The curse can only be lifted
by a greater restoration spell or by bringing the treasure
back and begging forgiveness from the Oracle.

The heroes have rescued the Oracle from the clutches
of a hag and cemented their place as the subjects of her
prophecy. Now, it seems that the party must perform
three mighty tasks in order to prepare themselves for a
confrontation with the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria.
Both Proteus and Kyrah are capable of interpreting
the Oracle's vision. Proteus has extensive knowledge
of Thylea's geography and culture, but he believes that
these tasks may truly be impossible. Kyrah is more likely
to prod the party into action-she's eager for an exciting
story to inspire her poetry.

THE ORACLE'S PROPHECY

Once the Oracle has been rescued from the sea hag, she
thanks the heroes and introduces herself. Centuries ago,
she foresaw the coming of great warriors who would
save Thylea in her hour of need.
Now, Versi delivers the full prophecy to those in
attendance.




The Oracle inhales the vaporous fumes that surround
her. She stares into each of your eyes, probing your
souls with her penetrating gaze. Some time passes
before she speaks.
"You warriors who stand here gathered will be
tested. The Fates have revealed three great tasks that
must be accomplished before you are ready to sail
into the three seas and face the Titans."
"You must shape the silver fires of the lost forge in
order to craft the tools that you will need. You must
claim the mighty weapons wielded against the Titans
by the first Dragonlord. And you must drink deep from
the bottomless dragon horn, for it will reveal a vision
that I cannot see."
"But woe unto thee, for I have seen the end of all
things. My father's anger cannot be quelled, and his
sister schemes even now. Your quest may yet fail and,
if it should, the sky will rain black fire, and the doom of
Thylea will come."


1. Claim the Weapons of the Dragonlords
The weapons of the first Dragonlords were forged at the
Mithral Forge by the god Volkan, and all were capable of wounding the Titans and those descended from
them. These are located in Telamok, a necropolis in
the Mithral Mountains. The tombs were built to house
the remains of the Dragonlords who came to Thylea
five centuries ago. No one ever goes there now, as it's
guarded by an undead gatekeeper known as Damon,
who must be paid with a special kind of coin before he
will allow anyone entrance. Proteus gives the heroes one
burnished dragonlord coin and tells them to keep it safe.
2. Light the Fires of the Mithral Forge
The Mithral Forge was used by the dwarves to construct the weapons of the gods in the First War. The
Forge can be used to build powerful magical items

Versi the Oracle


With the Oracle's full prophecy delivered, it's time for
the heroes to undertake three great tasks. But first, she
will speak with each hero, revealing specific information
about each of their epic paths.
Epic Paths: Meeting the Oracle
Versi has valuable information for heroes using every epic
path. This is an important opportunity to recognize the
backstory and motivations of every epic path in the party.
Don't miss this chance to make your players feel special.
Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.
The Vanished One. Versi will treat the Vanished One
differently than the other heroes. She will ask to speak
to this particular hero privately in her cave, where she
will remind them that they must return to her when the
Great Labors have been completed.

In spite of her heritage, Versi has always shown herself
to be a true ally of the settler races. If anything, she
loves mortals just a little too much.



or repair ancient magical items that no longer work.
Kyrah suggests that the party travel to the city of
Estoria. A clan of dwarves works the local copper
mines, and they are likely to know more about the
Forge's whereabouts.
3. Drink From the Horn of Balmytria
The Horn of Balmytria is an actual dragon horn that a
famed silver dragon lost in battle against the gygans. It
was recovered by the priests of Mytros and consecrated
by the Five. It reputedly has many magical powers
including the ability to grant visions to those who drink
from it. The horn was stowed in a reliquary in the city of
Estoria and, as far as anyone knows, it's still there.
If the heroes ask about the "three seas" Kyrah will
explain that it almost certainly refers to the Cerulean
Gulf, the Forgotten Sea, and the legendary Nether Sea.
Compelled by Prophecy
Even if the heroes refuse to undertake the tasks, the
people of Mytros believe that the prophecy must be
fulfilled, and the gods will conspire to move the quest
forward. Everyone the party encounters will know them
as the 'Chosen Ones.'

LEAVING THE TEMPLE



This is a good time to introduce the concept of Fame
to your players. Each time the heroes complete a quest
or perform a great deed, they earn Fame. As the party's
Fame increases, they unlock perks. See the Benefits of
Fame table in the Creating Heroes appendix for details.
Kyrah also signals that she will be following the heroes
and watching over them, with the intention of composing an epic poem about their exploits.
Epic Poetry Battle. If the party already has a bard
who wishes to serve as an epic poet, then Kyrah offers
them a challenge: the two of them will compose separate
epics, and when the quest is done, they will each read
their poem aloud at the Theater of the Gods in Mytros to
see which version of the story gets the most applause.
Finally, Kyrah offers one last suggestion before the party
continues onward.




"There is one tiny problem, though. The tricky thing
about fame is, if you're not careful, one hero might outshine all the others. Then all the stories will be about
that one hero and how strong and valiant they are -
and all the rest of you will be yesterday's news."
"So... I encourage you to swear an Oath of
Fellowship. This is a sacred oath that will bind you
together in the spirit of solidarity. When one of you
wins fame, all of you will share it. And, who knows?
Perhaps the magic of the oath will even protect you
against some of the dangers that lie ahead."






If the heroes elect to swear the oath, then your players
should each read the following aloud:

"The future of Thylea may be bleak, but there is always
hope. The people of this land will look to your actions
as a sign of things to come. Seek neither fame nor
fortune, but show them the true meaning of heroism.
Make yourselves a beacon of light as we enter this time
of darkness, and go with the blessing of this temple."


Kyrah's Advice: Winning Fame
After Proteus has departed, Kyrah offers the heroes
another take on the tasks ahead.
40



The Oath of Fellowship

The party should choose one of the three Labors before
leaving the temple. Kyrah volunteers to serve as a
guide and traveling companion. She won't take no for
an answer. She recommends traveling to Estoria first,
because the Horn of Balmytria should be there, on display at the Dragon Shrine (E7). She also gives the heroes
the golden arrows that she promised as a reward.
Parting Gifts. Before the party leaves the temple,
Proteus intercepts the heroes and thanks them for
saving Versi from the clutches of the sea hag. He is
skeptical that any of these so-called 'Great Labors' may
be accomplished by mortals, but he believes that Thylea
desperately needs heroes who are willing to try. He gives
each of the heroes one potion of healing and takes his
leave of the party with encouraging words:




"Listen to me - forget what Proteus said. This is your
chance to win fame beyond your wildest dreams. You
want fame, right? Of course you do. All great heroes
want fame. Fame is the path to immortality."
"These 'Great Labors' are only the beginning. The
path ahead of you will be filled with opportunities for
winning fame. If you truly manage to rise to your fate
and confront the Titans, then poets will sing of your
deeds for ages to come."

Ch apter 1 - Heroes of the Prophec y





"I am name, and I swear upon my life and my honor
that I will uphold the oath of fellowship with the warriors who stand at my side."




As they swear the oath, the heroes should toast with a
round of wine. You may choose to re-enact this ritual at
the table for extra dramatic effect.

The Great Labors
"I miss my mother dearly, but I wish she had

he heroes have rescued the Oracle
from the clutches of the witch Heleka, and in
the process, they've learned the first portion
of what the Fates have in store for them. Now,
they must undertake a series of Great Labors in order to
prepare for their confrontation with the Titans.

Running the Adventure
The party's next destination is the city of Estoria, which
should serve as a base for the heroes for this chapter.
In Estoria, they will meet up with characters and hear
rumors that will lead them to the three locations that
must be visited to complete their Great Labors.
Estoria offers many other activities and quests for the
heroes to engage with. These are all optional, but they
should help immerse players in the world of Thylea.

The Great Labors
The party must perform 2-3 of the following tasks.

• Claim the weapons of the Dragonlords
• Light the fires of the Mithral Forge
• Drink from the Horn of Balmytria
1. Claim the Weapons of the Dragonlords
This task requires the heroes to travel to Telamok, the
necropolis in the Mithral Mountains. This requires a bit
of travel, and it's quite dangerous.
2. Light the Fires of the Mithral Forge
This task requires the heroes to locate the ancient
Mithral Forge. There is a clan of dwarves in Estoria that
works the local copper mines, and they are likely to
know more about the Forge's whereabouts.
3. Drink From the Horn of Balmytria
The Horn of Balmytria is kept in a reliquary in the city
of Estoria and, as far as anyone knows, it's still there.
Investigating the Dragon Shrine (E7) in Estoria is the
best place to start.
Meeting King Pythor
In addition to these Great Labors, the heroes will meet
King Pythor of Estoria. Pythor requires the heroes' aid
to prevent his daughter from being sacrificed.

The City of Estoria
Estoria is the largest settlement along the Arkelon River.
It is built into a rocky gorge, sprawling down from a
stone-walled fortress that faces the steppes to the north.
The Arkelon itself runs along the northern edge of the
fortress, and forms a natural moat that can only be
crossed by a bridge at the north gate or at the ford near
the Rock of Estor. On the far side of the river from the
city are grasslands where bands of centaurs patrol.

Approaching Estoria
Most travelers approach Estoria from the southern gate,
which is lightly guarded so that merchant caravans can
easily ferry their goods in and out of the city. The north
gate, on the other hand, is heavily guarded by suspicious
soldiers who will only admit the heroes once they recognize them as the Oracle's 'Chosen Ones.'




This is a summary of the important NPCs in Estoria.

• King Pythor (see appendix) is the legendary god of
battle who rules Estoria.

• Princess Anora (CG noble) is the favored daughter of
King Pythor and the pride of the city.

This settlement is nestled between the cliffs of a rocky
gorge. The north wall of the town is part of a stone
fortress, and protects the town from any dangers that
might come from the steppes. Houses, taverns, and
shops of all kinds sprawl down from the fortress, filling
much of the gorge. The northern wall is defended by
a legion of soldiers, while the southern gates admit a
steady stream of travelers and merchant caravans. The
road that runs south from the gate is lined with tileroofed inns.


Important NPCs

• Volkan (see appendix) is a grumpy dwarven blacksmith who is actually the God of the Forge.

• Delphion (NG veteran) is the innkeeper who runs
the Dragon's Tooth, a public house.

• Aesop (NG elven priest) is the keeper of the Dragon
Shrine, where the Horn of Balmytria is enshrined.

• Gaius (see appendix) is the commander of the Order
of Sydon, who demands that Anora be sacrificed.

• Pericles (CG scout) is a retired scout who tends the

The Looming War
Estoria has stood for centuries as the greatest defense
against the centaurs, cyclopes, manticores and other
dangers to be found on the steppes north of the Arkelon
River. The fortress city has been in steady decline since
its god-king, Pythor, began to drown his sorrows in
wine. Now, conflict threatens to swallow Estoria, and
panic is setting in among its citizens.

• Thobos (LG halfling noble) is the mayor of
Woodhike, a nearby settlement.

ARRIVAL IN ESTORIA

When the heroes first arrive in Estoria, run the following encounters:

Encounter: The Southern Gates


• The surrounding farms have few livestock remaining,
exhausted by the daily sacrifices demanded by Sydon.

• The city is experiencing a drought, because the Lord
of Storms is withholding rain from this region.

• Cyclopes have been crossing the river and pillaging
farms along the road to Mytros.

• Centaurs are gathering in record numbers, and are

obviously preparing to assault the city.
• Sydon has demanded that the king's daughter be sacrificed on the night of the next full moon.
• King Pythor has gone mad with grief for his daughter.

42

Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s



Approaching the city from the south, you encounter
a caravan of merchants who are also headed towards
Estoria. With them are the first domesticated animals
you have seen in some time, a herd of bony oxen lumbering along the dusty road. The merchants seem tired,
and they greet you warily.


The oxen are to be delivered to the temple, where they
will be added to the other daily sacrifices made to Sydon.
There are barely any draft animals left in the countryside, and even these sickly animals will fetch a high price
because of the king's desperation to appease the Titan.
The merchants (LN commoners) share this sad tale with
the heroes. They also describe the marauding cyclopes
and centaurs that make the roads dangerous to travel.

KEY LOCATIONS

Quest: Summoned by the King
When the king learns that the Oracle's 'Chosen Ones'
have entered Estoria, he immediately sends six soldiers
to fetch the heroes and escort them to his palace.


E1. Public Amphitheater



The streets grow more crowded as you enter the city
proper. Travelers and citizens mingle, exchanging both
goods and gossip. Guards line the streets, though they
are most concentrated by the city gates. Despite their
attempts to present a stoic facade, you sense that they
are restless about something.
A small detachment of hoplites moves towards you
from the north. One man bearing an officer's insignia
steps forward from his fellows and respectfully hails
your party.




The circular stage of the open air theater has been built
into the bottom of a hill away from the center of town.
Rows of seats taking the form of inlaid stone blocks
spread up the slope of the hill, giving onlookers a clear
view of any performers below.




The guards treat the heroes with cautious reverence,
but they cannot refuse the king's orders. They encourage the heroes to comply, as they are afraid to return to
the king empty-handed. They seem nervous about the
troubles brewing in Estoria, as it is widely believed that
King Pythor has gone mad.
Quest Hook: The King's Daughter
This encounter begins The King's Daughter. It's strongly
recommended that you run that part of the adventure
before allowing the heroes to explore Estoria.

RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

These encounters are an easy way to add color to the
city. Roll on the table below whenever you want
something unusual to happen in the city.
Random Encounters in Estoria



This is a small open air local theater. It is used for
festivals, plays, and major public announcements. Most
famously, the annual wine festival takes place here.
Whenever the wine festival is active, priests of
Lutheria come to town, often with fey performers. The
wine festival might happen when the heroes return to
Estoria after finishing one of the Labors. Otherwise, it
might take place in the city of Mytros, later on.
Event: The Wine festival
Whether the festival takes place in the simple theater
in Estoria or the grander one in Mytros, it is the same
event. The festival of three plays lasts for one week and
is led by Tassos (CE priest), a priest of Lutheria. Tassos
gives three performances over the course of a week:

• The Fall of Estor. This tragedy takes place during the

First War and depicts Estor Arkelander's final days. In
the end, he sacrifices himself to save the entire crew of
his legendary ship, the Ultros.
• The Plight of Pellenia. This dark comedy takes
place in Hypnos, the Throne of Dreams. Lutheria is
depicted as charming and sympathetic as she tortures
Pellenia, an acerbic bard with no sense of humor.
• Pythor and the Five Sisters. This tragedy describes
the tumultuous love affair between Pythor and his
jealous wife, Hexia. Pythor is depicted as an irascible
idiot who bumbles his way into becoming king.

of drinking, eating, and carousing.
In addition to human and elven actors (CN commoners) Tassos uses satyrs in the performances. The
satyrs act in the comedy and perform music for the two

and an oread nymph named Aria. The green hag uses
her illusory appearance ability to hide her identity, while
the nymph dresses and applies make-up to appear more

Predatory Hag. If Seema notices any of the heroes
watching her performance, she takes an immediate
interest in them. She flirts with them afterwards, with
the intention of convincing them to accompany her

murder the hero and eat their heart. Aria will try to
intervene and shoo the hero away to safety, but Seema
characterizes Aria's intervention as bitter jealousy.

This gate includes a fortified stone bridge that crosses
the Arkelon River. The atmosphere at the gate is tense,
as disciplined soldiers stand off against jeering bands
of centaurs on the steppes just beyond the river. The
heavy wooden doors of the gate are apparently kept
shut and barred at all times.



This gate leads to the northern steppes. The great
wooden doors are kept shut and barred, opening twice
daily for scouting parties that patrol the steppes. The
towers are manned by a dozen soldiers.

E3. South Gate




This gate is bustling with merchants and travelers,
many of whom pull heavy carts behind them. The gate
is guarded by two bored-looking soldiers.


This gate is where most merchants enter and leave
the city, traveling along the main road through the
Heartlands. The gate is guarded at all times by two soldiers, and the guard changes at sunrise and sunset.





Estoria's well-trodden streets converge at the bustling
central agora. A motley assortment of stalls litters
the area, from canopies of fine silk to stacks of rotted
wooden crates. Merchants at the stalls eagerly vie for
your attention with a wide variety of quality wares, all of
which seem very reasonably priced.


E2. North Gate



This gate leads eastward into the vineyards and gardens
that supply the city with much of its wine. The area is
well-protected by the surrounding rocky cliffs, so there
are seldom any guards here.

Attending the Wine Festival
The Wine Festival can be used to help teach the players
about the world. If heroes choose to stop by and watch
one of the performances, you might choose to read aloud
one of the Myths of Thylea. You could even act out a scene
from one of your favorite Greek comedies or tragedies.



This gate is quiet, though you can hear the sounds of
the city echoing through the streets. The floral scents
of gardens and sweet vineyards drift from the east.



The center of activity in Estoria is the agora, the large
open area that serves as the marketplace and public
square for the town. Around the outside of the agora are
long, open air buildings that have shops in the back.
Despite the variety of shops here, the selection of
adventuring gear is rather limited. Basic tools, weapons,
and armor are available for sale, but more advanced
items, such as platemail and crossbows, cannot be
found. If the heroes ask for such things, the merchants
will grudgingly refer them to Volkan's Hall (E9).
Event: Cursed Grave Robber
A starved looking man named Claus (NE bandit) is desperately trying to sell an emerald necklace that he claims
to have found at the Necropolis at Telamok. The necklace is a necklace of fireballs with a single gem left. Claus
is willing to sell it for 1 gp, but none of the merchants in
Estoria are willing to buy it. If the heroes agree to buy
it off of Claus, one of the merchants will intervene and
explain that Claus is a graverobber.
The merchant explains that Claus managed to sneak
past Damon, the guardian of Telamok, and gain entry
to the Necropolis. He stole the necklace from one of
the tombs and is now cursed by the gods. As long as he
has the necklace he is unable to eat: he just throws up
everything. The only way to end the curse is for him to
sell the necklace to someone who knows how he got it.
If he lies when he tries to sell it, or leaves it somewhere,
he always wakes up with it in his possession.
If a hero still foolishly buys the necklace, then they
become afflicted by the curse of the graverobber. Refer to
Introduction: The Laws of Thylea for details.

Aesop (NG priest). Aesop has heard the prophecy, and
he has bad news for the party: the Horn of Balmytria
has been stolen from the reliquary. Thieves broke into
the shrine two nights ago and escaped with it. Aesop
will answer any questions the heroes may have about
the horn, and he welcomes an investigation for clues in
the reliquary.
Investigation: The Reliquary


This is the residential district of the city. The citizens of
Estoria are divided into three neighborhoods. The soldiers live in the first area, the craftsmen in the second,
and the farmers in the third. These homes are walled off
from the outside, but each includes a spacious interior
courtyard which provides an open view of the sky.

The reliquary is a small stone chapel with three alcoves
protected by glass. The glass of the central alcove has
been shattered, and dark purple stains are splattered all
over the floor surrounding it.


E7. The Dragon Shrine




This shrine sits at the end of a quiet street that runs
into the wall of the gorge. It's a large stone building
with a copper dome. The pediment above the door
bears a marble engraving of the legendary dragon,
Balmytria. Inside the building, there is a strong smell of
incense. You can hear the muttering of prayers, as the
priests of the shrine carry out their daily rituals.

Dragon Shrine

Investigating the reliquary reveals many small hoofprints among the stains. The stains are spilled wine, and
they form a haphazard trail that leads out of the building
and into an adjoining alleyway. The party may follow the
stains a short distance until the trail becomes too difficult to follow. At this point, the thieves can be tracked
with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check, or by
using the detect magic spell, which reveals that the wine
stains glow faintly with magic.
Following the trail leads the party into the Oldwoods
south of town. It continues for about 10 miles, all the
way to the Mossy Temple.
Returning the Horn of Balmytria
If the heroes return the Horn of Balmytria to the reliquary, Aesop will be overjoyed. If the heroes have not
yet taken a drink from the horn, then Aesop will urge
them to do so now. This is a sacred ritual that should
grant the heroes clarity on their quest.
Aesop asks the heroes to swear an oath to take the
horn to Queen Vallus in Mytros. He warns the heroes
that King Acastus may attempt to claim the horn as a
symbol of his right to resurrect the Dragonlords. Aesop
believes that in these uncertain times, the horn rightfully belongs to the Goddess of Wisdom.
The Keeper of the Dragon Shrine
Aesop is one of the few priests who still honor the
legends of the Dragonlords. In the age before the
First War, the dragons were chief among the forces
that protected the mortals of Thylea. Aesop believes
that the dragons will return one day. He knows that
King Acastus of Mytros has sworn to resurrect the
ancient order of the Dragonlords, and he has heard
rumors that the king now has a small flight of dragons
under his command. For his part, Aesop believes that
if anyone is to resurrect the Dragonlords, it should be
the Oracle's Chosen Ones.

E8. The Dragon's Tooth




A nondescript brick building with carved white stone
accents, the popular public house distinguishes itself by
the sheer amount of activity in and around it. Patrons
regularly drift in and out in varying states of sobriety.
The scent of food and sounds of raucous conversation
emanate from the open door and windows.


The patrons of The Dragon's Tooth are talkative. The
heroes can learn many rumors by speaking to the merchants, soldiers, and farmers who gather there:
Rumors in the Dragon's Tooth



This public house is frequented by merchants and
soldiers staying at the thatched inns in the southern
outskirts of town. Lodging at an inn can be arranged
with the bartender, a wiry old white-haired man named
Delphion (NG veteran). He is friendly and knowledgeable, but has little patience for small-talk or superstition. He knows of the party's quest, and will help them
however he can.

Rumor

1

Teenagers in the region have been disappearing
lately, including Thericles's daughter. Thericles is
the old man who runs the vineyards in Estoria.

2

A massive hurricane is brewing off the coast of
Mytros. It could be weeks before it's safe to travel
to the city. The roads nearby are closed.

3

The Order of Sydon have demanded the destruction of the Temple of the Five in Mytros.

4

A band of warriors traveled to the Necropolis
last month and haven't been heard from since.
Everyone knows that the place is forbidden.

5

King Acastus of Mytros has fulfilled his promise
to revive the Dragonlords of old. Several farmers
claim to have spotted his dragons flying overhead.

6

The copper mines of Estoria are struggling to produce enough ore to meet the needs of the city. If
only the Mithral Mines could be reclaimed...

7

Everyone agrees that Princess Anora would make
a much better ruler than her father, King Pythor.
Everyone loves Pythor, but he's a terrible king.

Volkan, the old dwarven blacksmith, has been
grumpier than usual lately. He claims to be the
God of the Forge. Everyone just humors him.

Stepping through the door, you see that the busy street

Quest: The Dwarves of Estoria
There are several dwarves who visit The Dragon's Tooth
every night. They work the local copper mine.
The dwarves are part of a clan that was forced to flee
the Mithral Mines centuries ago. Some of them are old
enough to have been alive when that event took place.
They have no interest in returning to the Mithral Mines,
even if it were to be cleared out, because they know that
the entire place was cursed by the Titan, Lutheria.
However, some of the oldest members of the clan are
still seeking closure. They would like to bury the kin
that they lost in the Mithral Mines, and they are willing
to pay 10 gp for each dwarven skull returned to them.

Volkan the
Blacksmith

E9. Volkan's Hall




Near the center of town is a large building with fortified stone walls and a shingle roof. A sign hangs from
the building's heavy, bronze-banded doors. It reads,
Volkan's Hall. Inside the hall, you are greeted by the
warm glow of embers and blasts of hot air. The room
is decorated with a variety of bronze armors, weapons,
and farming tools. A weathered-looking dwarf works at
an anvil near the blistering forge at the back of the hall.
He wipes the sweat from his brow and greets you.


Volkan's Reward
If the heroes chose to sacrifice the great boar to Volkan,
then he will recognize them immediately and grant them
their reward. He has spent the last few days crafting it,
and he's quite proud of the results. Roll on a lesser magic
item table for the result.



Volkan (see appendix) is actually the legendary God of
the Forge and King Pythor's father. He is not secretive
about being one of the Five Gods, but locals have long
thought of him as a strange dwarf with delusions of
grandeur. He doesn't bother to correct them.
Volkan comes across as unbalanced, forgetful, and
myopic. He provides blacksmithing services to Estoria
and all the farming communities in the Heartlands. He
can usually be found at his anvil, grumbling about all the
work to be done. Volkan is assisted by a gangly teenaged
boy named Theo (NG commoner), who minds the
stables and runs errands in town.
Quest: The Mithral Mines
Volkan recognizes the heroes as the Oracle's Chosen,
and he is vaguely impressed. He rambles at great lengths
about the ancient forge in the Mithral Mines. He speaks
of the great weapons and artifacts that were forged there
in ages past, before Lutheria cursed the place.
Volkan vows to join the heroes in the Mithral Mines
once they have rekindled the fires of the forge.

Dad never showed his feelings much, and he was always
busy in his workshop. But every year on my nameday,
I would find some new magical trinket hidden under
my pillow. That's how I know he cares.

E10. The King's Palace




The once-great Estorian Palace looms high over the
city. Large windows let in copious amounts of sunlight,
which fails to chase away the gloom that has settled
in the palace. As you walk the halls, you notice evidence of the court's past glory in the form of precious
artifacts dating back to the First War. Extravagant
tapestries show tales of Estoria's history and King
Pythor's grand adventures, though more recent events
are nowhere to be seen on the hangings.




The Estorian palace is simple in design. It boasts a single
great hall flanked by side chambers for the kitchens,
servant's quarters, and bedrooms. At the back is a
stairway that descends to the basements where storage
chambers and dungeons are located. King Pythor (see
appendix) can always be found in the great hall, accompanied by a half-dozen of his advisors (LN nobles).
The first time the heroes come to the palace, refer to
the adventure section, The King's Daughter.

E11. The Rock of Estor




Jutting out of the shallows of the Arkelon River, the
Rock of Estor is less impressive than its name would
suggest. Its flat surface forms a natural altarpiece
where numerous sacrifices have evidently taken place.
There is an iron pole stuck directly in the center of
the rock, and white stones are scattered around its
base. Strong rapids rush past the rock noisily.


by a cyclops that throws boulders at them from 200 ft.
away. He will (deliberately) miss several times, but if
the heroes don't get the message, he will begin to aim
directly at them. If they attack him, a band of a dozen
centaurs will come to the cyclops's aid.

E13. The Estorian Vineyards




This rock sits in the middle of the Arkelon River. It is
15 ft. in diameter and stands only a few feet out of the
water. The rock sits in the middle of a ford across the
river that is only 2-3 ft. deep across its entire width. The
top of the rock is smooth with the iron pole sticking in
center, surrounded by chunks of white rock.
Sacrifices to Sydon are made at the rock. Almost
every day, two members of the Order of Sydon (LN
guards) lead a cow out to the rock. They tie the cow to
the iron pole and then hurry away. A few minutes later,
two basilisks (with swim speeds of 20 ft.) emerge from
the water and scuttle over to the cow. They turn the
cow to stone and then devour the petrified remains.
This takes a few minutes, and then they scuttle back
into the river.
Encounter: Basilisks
The basilisks have a cave one mile to the north, and
a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals
tracks leading into the cave. The cave is only accessible by swimming underwater and then up into a small
grotto where the basilisks have a nest.
Between sacrifices, four basilisks can be found here,
and there are four eggs in the nest. If all four basilisks
are killed, they will no longer show up for sacrifices.

SURROUNDING LANDS



Thericles (NG scout) used to serve the King but has
now retired to the outskirts of Estoria to tend to his
vineyard with his husband. He is descended from the
Phobas family line of the Dragonlords, and he is highly
respected by the citizens of Estoria. He is currently in
despair because his daughter Corinna has gone missing.
Quest: Missing Daughter
Thericles wants someone to find out what has happened
to his daughter. She disappeared into the Oldwood a
week ago, and Thericles has been unable to track her.
In actuality, Corinna is one of many teenagers who
have been lured into the Mossy Temple by a tribe of
goatlings who serve the corrupted dryad, Demetria.
Reward. If the heroes are able to rescue Corinna and
bring her back, Thericles is overjoyed. While he is not a
wealthy man, he does have a family heirloom: a javelin of
lightning. He gladly gives it to the heroes as a reward.



Grassland stretches across the horizon as far as you
can see. The sun shines down from a perfect, cloudless
blue sky. A refreshing breeze blows across your skin
and through the waves of green grass. The picturesque
serenity of this vast, rolling landscape is at odds with the
dangers that lurk in this untamed wilderness.

The lands north of Estoria and across the Arkelon
River are too dangerous for travel. Bands of centaurs
patrol the grasslands just a few miles away from Estoria.
Occasionally a cyclops will lumber through the grasslands as well. If the heroes are determined to explore
the lands north of the Arkelon they will be discouraged



You follow a small trail away from the road and into the
forested hills. After an hour of travel, the trees grow
dense, and the canopy blocks most of the sky.
Eventually, you emerge into an expansive forest
glade carpeted with golden leaves. Several dozen small
huts and houses are scattered throughout the glade,
along the banks of a clear stream. Gnomes and halflings bustle about the area, tending small sheep, foraging for berries, and collecting kindling for their fires.

E12. The Northern Steppes




This lonely vineyard is on the outskirts of the city.
Wooden trellises erupt from the tilled soil in neat, symmetrical rows. Healthy green vines wind around these
structures, bearing a bountiful crop of brilliant purple
grapes. After some walking, you find a fit middle-aged
man among the vines, pruning the plants with great
care. Upon hearing your approach, the man turns to
greet you. Although he appears friendly, his brow is
deeply furrowed with apprehension.







The people of Woodhike are quite friendly, and the
children are endlessly curious about adventurers. Two
friendly sprites live in the nearby woods, and they love
to play pranks on visitors.

If the party wishes to speak to someone in the village,
Thobos (LG halfling noble) will invite them into his
house for tea. Thobos is the mayor of Woodhike, and he
travels to Mytros twice a year to represent the smallfolk.
He offers the party anything he can to help with their
quest, but all the beds in Woodhike are for small races.
Once the tea is poured and formalities are out of the way,
Thobos asks the party for their help with his problems.





Quest: Bandits
Recently, animals have been going missing, and the
sprites have discovered trees felled by axes. Thobos
believes that there are human poachers living somewhere nearby. There is in fact a group of bandits about
a mile upstream, led by a woman named Korteva (CE
bandit chief). She's somehow bullied a gentle-natured
cyclops into joining her gang, and he is convinced that
the bandits are his friends.

The party can persuade the cyclops that the bandits
are not his friends with a successful DC 18 Charisma
(Persuasion) check. Otherwise, if the party threatens the
bandits in any way, the cyclops joins the attack in order to
protect his so-called 'friends.'
The cyclops is neutral good, so killing him is an evil
act. If the party manages to separate the cyclops from the
bandits, then Thobos is willing to adopt him.

After following the stream for a mile or so, you hear
the sounds of thunderous footsteps just ahead. Soon,
the originator of those loud footfalls comes into view:
a muscular, twelve-foot tall cyclops. He smiles and
waves in your direction. In the trees beyond, you can
see a party of humans sitting around a fire.

The King's Daughter
The heroes have been summoned to the Estorian Palace
to meet with King Pythor. Pythor is one of the Five
Gods-the legendary God of Battle. But now, he is said
to be mad with grief over his many lost loves, and the
imminent sacrifice of his daughter, Anora.
The Order of Sydon has demanded that the princess
be sacrificed to the Lord of Storms. If this is not done,
then an army of centaurs and cyclopes will descend
upon Estoria and slaughter all the people of the city.
Because King Pythor is one of the Five Gods, he is
bound by the Oath of Peace. He cannot take up arms
against the Titans until the oath ends. Only the heroes
can intervene to save his daughter.

The History of King Pythor
King Pythor has ruled over Estoria for several centuries, having taken power when he overthrew the
tyrant king Lysis Arkelander, a descendant of Estor
Arkelander (after whom the city is named). The long
years have not been kind to the god-king. He has had
more than a dozen wives and countless mistresses, but
those he loved the most have almost always come to
gruesome ends, thanks to the green dragon Hexia. No
one knows why the dragon has such hatred for Pythor,
but the loss of so many loved ones has driven Pythor
to drink.
Although the people of Estoria love him, Pythor is
essentially a womanizing drunkard. He abdicates all his
responsibilities in favor of hunting, seducing the latest
beauty at court, or indulging in drunken and self-pitying excesses that last for days.

I think people love the idea of my brother more than
they love the man himself. It's true that his exploits are
legendary, and as a poet, I can't help but love the stories.

But centuries of wearing the crown have dulled his spirits.

as she will do anything to protect her city. Knowing this,
Pythor has locked her away in the dungeons to prevent
her from leaving the palace.

When the heroes arrive in the throne room, Pythor
is drunk and attempting to fight the statues of the
Five Gods, which line the hall. As the Oracle's chosen
arrive, his attendants withdraw, whispering nervously
among themselves. This leaves only the King to speak
with the heroes.


Possible Solutions



Once the room has emptied and the chamber doors
are shut, the King tosses away his spear and sits heavily
upon his throne, holding his head in his hands. He
beckons you to come closer. "You are the Oracle's
Chosen, yes? Let me tell you of my woes..."




If Kyrah is with the heroes, then she will step forward to
lecture King Pythor, who is her brother.




Before Pythor can continue, Kyrah brashly interrupts
him. "Whatever your 'woes' may be, drowning yourself
in wine will not solve them," she scolds. "You have a
duty to serve your people in these dark times! This
wallowing does no one any good."
King Pythor hangs his head at her harsh words. "That
may be true, but what can be done? The Oath of Peace
binds my hands. And now, the Titans conspire to steal
away my precious daughter, Anora."
"But perhaps... perhaps you heroes can aid me."




Pythor will tell the heroes of the problems that face him.
Several weeks ago, the Order of Sydon sent a detachment of warriors to Estoria with demands from the Lord
of Storms. The Titan demanded that Pythor's daughter
Anora (LG noble) should be chained to the Rock of
Estor amid the rushing waters of the Arkelon River, and
left there overnight as an offering to Sydon.
Princess Anora
Anora is Pythor's only child by his last mortal wife, a
woman he dearly loved. Years ago, Anora's mother was
carried away to the Forgotten Sea by the evil dragon,
Hexia.
The Army of Sydon
If this sacrifice is not accomplished by the next full
moon, then all the gathered tribes of the centaurs will
descend upon Estoria and raze the city to the ground.
Sydon has already starved the city with this latest
drought, and he always makes good on his threats. If
Pythor doesn't comply and sacrifice his daughter, it will
mean the deaths of thousands.
The Rock of Sacrifice
To be chained to the Rock is to be devoured by the
beasts of the river. Princess Anora is resigned to her fate

The heroes can discuss solutions with Pythor and Kyrah.
The heroes need not act immediately; they have the
time to complete one Great Labor before the next full
moon. However, if the heroes fail to show up, the Order
of Sydon will carry out the sacrifice by force, with Anora
going willingly to her doom.
Pythor, all kingly dignity washed away, will beg the
heroes to help protect his daughter. He suggests the
following possible courses of action:

• Negotiate with the Order of Sydon. The heroes could
persuade the Order of Sydon to choose another sacrifice. Pythor offers fifty oxen (worth 100 gp each) for
this solution. He knows that the Order will also want
another human, but he can't bring himself to suggest
anyone. If present, Kyrah will suggest that this may be
the best option available.
• Challenging the centaur chieftain. The heroes could
challenge the centaur chieftain to combat. If they
prevail, they could demoralize the army of centaurs
and cyclopes that have gathered along the northern
banks of the Arkelon. This would be a feat worthy
of the Dragonlords, but Kyrah thinks this would be
suicide, as the only way to disperse the army would be
to defeat the chieftan on unequal footing.
• Let Anora be sacrificed. The heroes can tell Pythor
that they are unable to help. If they do so, Pythor will
drink himself into a stupor before the sacrifice and
remain insensible for a week afterwards.

One additional option is to track down and kill the
basilisks that petrify those offered on the Rock of Estor.
No one will suggest this plan, so the heroes will have
to come up with this on their own. It should be noted
that doing so will not save the princess, for Lutheria
will send harpies to Anora's sacrifice to make sure of
the death.

Asking for Assistance
If the heroes ask for help in accomplishing their Great
Labors, King Pythor will direct them to talk to his father,
the dwarf Volkan who runs the local smithy. If pressed
as to how a dwarf could be his father, Pythor will apologetically explain that, "it's... complicated."
Epic Paths: Meeting Pythor
Pythor has valuable information for the Demi-god and the
Lost One. However, he will use this for leverage, and he
is significantly more helpful after Anora has been rescued.
Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

The Order of Sydon
The seven captains representing the Order of Sydon
can be found lodging in the palace. They are led by a
heavily-armored man named Gaius (see appendix). He
will turn down the offer of fifty oxen and will initially be
against anyone taking the place of Anora.
However, Gaius will change his mind if any of the
heroes suggest themselves as replacements. If they don't
think of this, he suggests it before they leave. He knows
that Sydon wishes to see the Oracle's Chosen killed, and
offering them up on the Rock of Estor would be a fitting
way to do it. Gaius will only agree to a substitution if all
of the heroes agree to be sacrificed together.

The Centaur Chieftain
King Pythor arranges for the heroes to meet with the
chieftain on the other side of Arkelon. The chieftain
comes with a dozen centaurs and two cyclopes. The
chieftain, Baenor, is a massive centaur (centaur hero
with maximum hit points), and he can be convinced
to participate in a ritual combat with a successful DC
20 Charisma (Persuasion) check (or with a particularly
strong argument).
Ritual Combat. If the heroes convince Baenor, then
he swears an oath that his army will leave the city in
peace if his side loses. Baenor will demand that there are
an equal number of combatants on both sides. He also
demands that all of the heroes participate in the battle.
Baenor leads the fight, joined by one cyclops, and the
remainder of his force are a number of centaur heroes
to equal the number of heroes. It should be obvious that
victory here will be almost impossible. Kyrah will advise
against it, especially if the heroes intend to use trickery,
as this will only anger the centaurs further.
If the heroes persist and are killed, Kyrah will gather
their bodies and bring them back to the palace, where
she spends one week reviving them.

central pole. The shackles can be unlocked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools. They
can also be destroyed by attacks (AC 15, 10 HP each).
On the far side of the river, twelve centaurs gather to
watch the proceedings. They will not intervene unless
attacked or anyone tries to get to their side of the river.
The Harpies Attack. Ten minutes after the heroes are
chained, three harpies will begin to circle one hundred
feet above the rock. The harpies have been sent by
Lutheria to watch over the spectacle of the sacrifice. The
harpies won't use their songs, but they will taunt the
heroes. If any of the heroes leave the Rock of Estor the
harpies will use their luring song to lure those particular heroes into the depths of the river, where they will
swoop down and attempt to kill them.
The Basilisks Attack. Twenty minutes after the
heroes are chained, two basilisks will emerge from
the river and attack anyone on the Rock of Estor. If the
basilisks have already been killed in their nest cave,
then nothing appears. The harpies, the centaurs and
the Order of Sydon will become increasingly agitated
as they wait for the basilisks. Eventually the harpies will
swarm down in a fury and try to kill the heroes.
If the heroes survive until sunrise, then Gaius and
his captains will grudgingly allow them to go free. The
terms of the sacrifice have been met, even if the Titan
himself is infuriated by the outcome.

CELEBRATION
WITH THE KING

If the heroes survive the Rock of Estor or prevail in a
battle against the centaur chieftain, Pythor will summon
them back to his throne room in the palace.

THE SACRIFICE



You are part of a grim procession that leads toward
the Rock of Estor in the River Arkelon. Gaius and
his knights lead you through the ford and onto the
sacrifical rock. After binding each of you by the leg
to the central pole, Gaius motions to you and says,
"You are now offered as a sacrifice to appease the
Lord of Storms. Remain here until the sun rises. If
you step away from the rock, this city will suffer the
wrath of Sydon."


Gaius and all seven of his captains accompany the
heroes to the Rock of Estor. Each person chained to
the Rock of Estor can only move up to 10 ft. from the





When you return to the palace, King Pythor is already
deep in his cups, celebrating your victory. He greets
each of you with a bone-crushing hug and a painful
slap on the back. "Warriors of the prophecy, you have
my eternal gratitude!"
"There was a time when I would have taken to the
fields to battle the centaur army single-handedly, but
alas, I fear my fighting days are behind me. Perhaps it's
time to officially retire my hammer..."


The king retrieves his hammer (Pythor's hammer) and
grants it to one of the heroes, giving preferential treatment to his demi-god children if any are present.
As the God of Battle, Pythor once used this hammer
to smash entire armies of gygans, centaurs, and cyclopes. There are countless stories about this hammer,
none of which Pythor can quite recall at the moment.
He explains that his father, Volkan, the God of the Forge,
created it. Volkan can use the hammer to craft mighty
weapons and armor at the Mithral Forge.

The measure of a hero is one's ability to protect those that
we care about most. The new Dragonlords cannot merely
be warriors with mighty weapons... they must also be
willing to make great sacrifices for the future of Thylea.
-Aesop, Keeper of the Dragon Shrine

Finally, the king declares a full week of celebration in
Estoria, in honor of the heroes. The heroes may choose
to stay and enjoy the week's celebrations. There will
be plays at the public theater that they can participate
in, as well as much feasting and drinking. If Kyrah is
present, she encourages the party to press on with
their Labors.

The Mithral Forge
The Mithral Forge was used by the dwarves to construct the gods' weapons in the First War. Almost all of
the powerful magical weapons and armor used by the
Dragonlords and their successors were created here. It
now lies abandoned by the dwarven smiths: the upper
levels have become the lair of a tribe of troglodytes, and
the lower levels are guarded by a terrifying beast.

The Abandoned Road


This long-abandoned road is rocky and overgrown with
roots and thorny shrubs. It winds westward along the
granite cliffs of the Estorian tributary. North of the
road are expansive steppes, and beyond that, hazy blue
mountains. The sky is gray and cold by day, but at night
the clouds withdraw to reveal a blanket of stars.

The History of the Forge
The Mithral Forge was a key component of the victory
of the Dragonlords over the armies of the Titans. The
dwarves that came across the seas with the Dragonlords
discovered this deposit of mithral and adamantine in the
central mountain range of the new continent. For more
than a decade, the mithral and adamantine was mined
and used to forge weapons, armor, and magical artifacts
for the mortal armies.
The Titan, Lutheria, decided that something had to be
done about the mine. She formed a pact with the Fates,
who used their magic to breed a terrifying cerberus
hound. Lutheria unleashed this hound to destroy the
forge and slaughter the dwarves.
After driving out the dwarves, the cerberus hound
made a lair in the mines and began to spawn hundreds
of death dogs. The Dragonlords tried to retake the
forge, but they were repeatedly driven back until they
were forced to abandon it entirely.
For several centuries the hound watched over the
ruined forge. However, a decade ago, some primordial
thing from the depths of the Underdark emerged and
killed it. The death dogs remained in the mine but,
without anything to direct them, they retreated into the
lower depths. Several tribes of troglodytes crept into the
upper levels soon afterwards.

TRAVELING TO
THE FORGE

The Arkelon River flows southward from the Mithral
Mountains and cascades over the Great Falls of Arkelon,
where it empties into the Cerulean Gulf. Setting out
from the North Gate of Estoria at dawn, the heroes may
follow an abandoned road through the steppes to reach
these falls by dusk.







This road was once used to ferry metal goods and ore
from the mines, until it was abandoned centuries ago.
The steppes are quiet and the trip is uneventful. At
sunset, the heroes encounter a band of centaurs.

The thunder of hooves can be heard from the north.

draw closer, you realize that they aren't riders at all.
They are centaurs-nomadic warriors with the torsos
of men and the lower bodies of horses.




Twelve centaurs will surround the heroes. If the centaurs
are attacked, they will fight only to subdue, not to kill.
The chief of the centaurs is named Hukar. He warns
the heroes that, if they are heading to the Great Falls,
then they should beware. Troglodytes dwell in the caves
there, emerging at night to hunt for food. He thinks that
two of his kin fell into the clutches of the foul creatures.
There is nothing he can do for them, as the paths and
tunnels of the mines are too treacherous for his kind.
Quest: The Missing Centaurs
If the heroes agree to search for Hukar's kin, then he
gives them an ivory horn. He tells them to blow the horn
on the riverbank of the Arkelon when they have discovered the fate of his kin, and he offers a reward.
Rewards. If the heroes discover the fate of the missing
centaurs, they may do as Hukar instructed. The horn
will summon the centaurs to the riverbank. They will

mourn their dead and invite the party to drink under the
stars with them. True to his word, Hukar will give the
heroes three potions of heroism as a reward.
Blood of Sydon. Hukar explains that the potions are
concocted from the blood of his tribe, who are blessed by
the Lord of Storms, the Ocean Father-Sydon. He knows
that the heroes are prophesied to confront the Titans, but
he encourages them to consider Sydon's great wisdom.

THE GREAT FALLS
OF ARKELON




This rocky promontory looks out over a spectacular
vista dominated by the Great Falls of Arkelon. The
river cascades over a sheer cliff and roars into a vast,
semi-circular lake, throwing up a white mist.
The Great Falls are almost beyond description. It's
as if an entire ocean has spilled over the edge of the
world, and you stand marveling at the space beyond.
You have never seen anything so grand. The sound of
rushing water is almost deafening, and the light of the
fading day gleams across the water like red gold.
Four massive statues of stone hands surround the
lake. To the south, you can see the river snaking down
from the mountains, through the Oldwoods, while
the snowcapped Mithral Mountains dominate the
western horizon.


Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s

A wooded path descends down to the misty riverbank,
where the collapsed entrance to the mines can be seen.
A secret pathway into the mines can be found here with
a trivial investigation.
The lake is flanked by four massive statues of hands,
two per side. These are the Hands of Kentimane, the
Elder Titan, but they are dormant for now.

The Collapsed Entrance
The main entrance to the mines is blocked by tons of
rubble and is completely inaccessible. This was done by
the dwarves when they fled from the cerberus hound, as
they hoped to keep the beast sealed away.

F1. Secret Pathway




This rocky ledge leads up from the riverbank and passes
through a short tunnel, which deflects an endless
cascade of water from the Great Falls. The ledge grows
narrower as it ascends, stretching for a quarter-mile
along a sheer cliff of slick black rock. Beyond the ledge,
a shimmering curtain of translucent water spills down
to crash on the rocks below. Cold white mist fogs your
vision, and roaring water drowns out all other sound.




This path leads under the waterfall. Anyone walking
along it is sprayed with water from the falls. Wet moss
covers the sides, though the path itself is well used and



relatively safe. This is the main path used by troglodytes
to go hunting at night. There is a rope ladder that leads
down to the river below that troglodytes use when they
go fishing. This pathway was carved into the cliffside
centuries ago when the dwarves were first exploring the
natural caves behind the waterfall.

The Troglodytes of Mithral Mountains
The troglodytes here are foul creatures that came from
the deep regions of the Underdark, far below the sunlit
lands of Thylea. They were driven to the surface by the
same primordial creature that killed the cerberus hound.
Now, they hunt for food on the surface at night. While
they dine mainly on fish, they consider the tortured flesh
of centaurs and civilized folk to be delicacies.
The hierarchy of the troglodytes is determined by
strength, with troglodyte brutes taking all the choicest
meats. Brutes usually stay within the troglodyte warrens,
forcing their weaker kindred to do the hunting.
Troglodytes like to attack by stealth, using their chameleon skin to merge into the walls of the Mithral Mines.
Typically, one troglodyte will grapple a victim at the
start of combat so that the victim's companions have to
choose to abandon their friend if they flee.
If the troglodytes manage to defeat the heroes, they
won't kill them but instead bring them to their king. The
heroes will awaken with all of the effects of a short rest,
but with none of their weapons.

Encounter: Troglodyte Foragers




A stink wafts up from below as four filthy-looking
humanoids clamber onto the path ahead. Each carries
a net full of wriggling fish. Upon seeing you, the
trogloytes drop their fish and chatter to each other.
The stench is nearly overwhelming. You notice a
hungry gleam in their eyes.




These troglodytes are part of a daily expedition sent
to fish the river further down from the falls. There are
three troglodytes and one troglodyte brute. They
attack the heroes as soon as they spot them.

F2. Forked Tunnel




This natural tunnel runs for fifty feet at a slight
incline. The floor is wet and moss grows along the
walls and ceiling. The floor is well-used, covered in
the tracks of the foul creatures from the waterfall.
The tunnel eventually forks. To the left, the tunnel
continues into a network of natural caves. A terrible
stench comes from this direction, along with echoing
shrieks of pain and horror. To the right, the tunnel
becomes a stonework passageway.


F4. The Prison Pit




THE TROGLODYTE CAVES

The troglodyte caves are inhabited by dozens of the
vile creatures, including broodmothers and litters of
troglodyte young. They are more organized than typical
troglodytes, because they have an intelligent king.

F3. Troglodyte Cave Entrance




A natural stair descends into a cavern lit by the flickering fire of a roasting pit. The partially-burnt body of
a centaur is spitted over the pit. Across the room is a
prison pen fashioned out of petrified timber. It is currently holding a centaur that is being tormented by a
half-dozen loathsome lizard people. The creatures poke
at the centaur with sharpened sticks and croak with
delight when he cries out in pain.



This corridor is heavily used. Every time the heroes
travel through the tunnel, there is a 1 in 6 chance that
they encounter a band of (2d4 + 2) troglodytes led by a
troglodyte brute. One troglodyte will run back to the
warrens to raise the alarm, while the other troglodytes
fight to the death.



The tunnel descends into the earth. Out of the darkness rises a stench worse than anything you have ever
known. The shrieking sound from deep within the
caves suddenly ceases.


The cave entrance is guarded by four troglodytes.
They press up against the sides of the tunnel and have
advantage on their Stealth checks due to their chameleon trait. Every six hours, the troglodyte guards here
are replaced by four new troglodytes from deeper in
the caves.



This prison pit is where the troglodytes keep any prey
that they capture. There are four troglodytes in the
room. In addition, two troglodyte brutes are hidden
against the walls, and they have advantage on Stealth
checks due to their chameleon trait. They attack immediately and fight to the death.
Captured Centaurs. The young centaur being held
captive here is Kaluk, one of Hukar's kin. The spitted
centaur is Hirak, who can still be saved with healing
spells if the heroes move quickly enough. He will die
within five rounds unless healed. Both Kaluk and Hirak
wish to leave the mines as quickly as possible.

F5. The Warrens


F8. Refuse Pit




This area seems to be a den of sorts. Straw mats lie
along the edges of the cave, and they are covered in
filth. The floor is littered with the bones of humans,
centaurs, and other creatures.




This cluster of tunnels and caves are where most of the
troglodytes dwell. The warrens are normally the resting
place for dozens of the creatures, but when the heroes
arrive, most of them are elsewhere. Two troglodytes
and two troglodyte brutes currently sleep in the caves.
If they hear the heroes coming, the troglodytes will hide
along the walls or in their own filth on the floors, preparing an ambush as the heroes investigate.



This cave is much colder than the previous areas. A
strange, cold wind blows from the southwest tunnel.




Three troglodytes and a troglodyte brute are here. The
southwest tunnel descends for several miles into the
Underdark. This is how the troglodytes originally made
their way to the surface. The vast network of caves that
makes up the deep regions of the world are beyond the
scope of this book.

F7. Brood Den


As you enter this cave, the hideous stench somehow
grows even worse. Three large troglodytes squat in
the center of the cave. From their looks, these are the
broodmothers for a litter of more than a dozen young.
The broodlings are currently tearing their weakest
sibling limb from limb as it squeals in terror.

Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s

Treasure
Buried 5 feet under the disgusting muck is a mithral
breastplate, mithral ringmail, an adamantine short
sword and an adamantine spear. None of these items
radiate magic, so the only way to find them is to poke
around in the refuse. Finding an item requires one
minute and a successful DC 15 Investigation check.
Anyone who touches the filth automatically fails at any
stealth-based activity until they can have a bath.

F9. The Troglodyte King




This chamber has rough-hewn stone steps that rise up
to a platform at the far end. On the platform is a huge
troglodyte sitting on a crude throne. This creature
wears a golden circlet, and he is flanked by several
others of his kind. He smiles wickedly and addresses
you in your language: "How dost thou, sweetlings?"


This is the troglodyte king. He has possessed his headband of intellect for over a century, but it has brought
him little cheer. He's fallen into a deep depression,
because he's surrounded by filthy idiots all the time, and
he has no one worth talking to. When the heroes arrive,
he is eager to engage them in conversation.



The broodmothers are bigger than average and have
the statistics of troglodyte brutes. They will viciously
defend their young and fight to the death.
There are twelve troglodyte broodlings (8 AC, 1
HP). They hiss at the heroes, but they do not attack. If
approached, they will try to bite the heroes. Such heroes
must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 1
piercing damage and become poisoned for 1 hour.
If the broodlings are not slain, they will grow into
adult troglodytes within 1 week. This may create a
minor moral dilemma for the party.

56










This is where the troglodytes leave their waste. Entering
this room requires each hero to make a successful DC 15
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

F6. Chilly Cave




A darkened pit gapes in the center of this chamber.
The sides of the pit are coated with wretched streaks
of black and brown. You choke on the stench, which
burns your eyes and nostrils.

The Eloquent Troglodyte
The king is able to speak the common tongue, but he
does so in an unusual manner. Caliban from Shakespeare's
The Tempest is a good inspiration for his style of speech.
Describing his predicament: This golden band taught
me language; and my profit on't is, I know how to curse.
The gods torment me; Oh! Such unworthy company
these foul things are.
Proposing a game of riddles: Thou makest me merry;
I am full of pleasure: let us play a game!
Reacting to insults: Prithee, tread softly, that my anger
not be unleashed upon thee!
Shouting encouragement to his brutes during battle:
Lo, lo, again! Bite them to death, I prithee.

Game of Riddles
The king moans about the unfairness of his predicament
and asks to engage the heroes in a game of riddles. He is
evil to the core, and plans to eat the party, no matter the
outcome of the game. However, he desperately wishes
to test his enhanced intellect against the heroes, so he
would prefer to outsmart them.

THE MITHRAL MINES

The mines were built out from a shaft that gives easy
access to a vein of mithral and adamantine mineral
deposits. The shaft descends for one mile into natural
caverns that connect with the Underdark. The dwarves
mined the easily accessible ore along the first 500 ft. of
the shaft before they were driven out by the cerberus
hound. The mithral and adamantine veins continue all
the way down to the Underdark. Untouched since the
dawn of time (except for the few decades the dwarves
mined it), the deposits are the greatest lodes of mithral
and adamantine in the world. The troglodytes inhabited the upper level of the mine until just a few days ago
when the death dogs arrived.

F12. Barracks






Ahead of you, the natural passage breaks into a tunnel
of what looks to be dwarven construction. A stone
bridge crosses overhead, and a narrow 5-foot-wide
ledge leads up to it. The bridge is apparently guarded
by a statue of a large, two-headed dog.

The tunnel extends into the deep shaft where the
mithral and adamantine can be found. Centuries ago,
dwarves discovered the veins of the valuable minerals
while exploring the natural caverns. The statue is a
death dog that was petrified by a cockatrice. It awakens
from its petrification 10 minutes after the heroes arrive.



This room looks like the scene of a recent battle.
There are several half-eaten troglodyte corpses in one
corner. Three statues of two-headed dogs stand at
the center of the room. There are also several rotting
wooden racks that might have once been used for
weapons and armor.

F10. Broken Entryway





There is a single cockatrice running around loose, and
it attacks the heroes. If the heroes wait around in this
room for more than one minute, the death dog's petrification ends and it also attacks.
These pens are used by the troglodytes to keep a flock
of cockatrices. The troglodyte king enjoys breeding
them and fighting them against each other. He also uses
the cockatrices to petrify prisoners so that they can be
preserved for later consumption. Sometimes he serves a
cooked cockatrice to 'honored guests.'
Just a few days ago, the death dogs from the lower
levels started exploring the upper levels. The dogs killed
the troglodytes in this room, but one of the troglodytes
let the cockatrices loose as a last resort. The cockatrices
ran amok. Some were eaten by the death dogs while
others used their power to petrify the beasts.

The king is accompanied by two troglodyte brutes
and one female troglodyte. The king is a troglodyte
brute with maximum hit points and 19 Intelligence.
Treasure. Aside from the king's headband of intellect,
he carries a single mithral ingot as a royal scepter. The
scepter is worth 500 gp.





This square chamber seems to have been used as a pen
for some sort of animals, but whatever was here has
escaped. Cages made from petrified wood lay broken
or open. A statue of a troglodyte stands in the middle
of the room, along with a statue of a two-headed
dog. Scattered about the room are about a half-dozen
corpses of what appear to be chickens.



There are two cockatrices in this room. They attack
when the heroes enter. The three death dog statues
will awaken from their petrification 10 minutes after
the heroes arrive. The death dogs awaken one at a time,
every two rounds.

F13. Storage Room




This looks like it was once a storage room. It's filled
with rotting sacks and broken crates.

This was once a storage room for the dwarves. It was

F17. The Deep Shaft




This massive hall is supported by a series of pillars,
many of which have been broken. The corpse of a gargantuan three-headed dog is splayed out in the center
of the room. Several two-headed hounds chew away at
the flesh of this rotting corpse. The skeletal remains of
dwarves are scattered everywhere.




There are three death dogs in this room. They attack
and fight to the death. The cerberus appears to have
been killed by something massive, which must have
come up from the Deep Shaft (F17).
Treasure. One of the dwarven skeletons wears a
mithral chain shirt. There are 25 dwarven skeletons.
Their skulls may be returned to the dwarves at The
Dragon's Tooth (E8) for proper burial.



F15. Dwarven Quarters




Rotting bunk beds and chests make it obvious that this
chamber was living quarters, of sorts.




The dwarves took most of their possessions when they
fled. The troglodytes have looted almost everything else,
but there are a few valuables that can be scavenged.
Room One. There is a sack buried underneath the
rotting furniture. It contains 65 sp.
Room Two. There is nothing of value in this room.
Room Three. One of the dwarven skeletons has a ring
with an amethyst worth 250 gp.

F16. Entrance Hall




This tunnel expands into a grand entrance hall, but it is
completely blocked by rubble after thirty feet.




This tunnel leads to the surface, but it is blocked by
many tons of rubble which cannot be moved.

When the mithral deposits were first discovered, I saw
little reason to celebrate. It was not until I first held
a mithral weapon that I appreciated the ingenuity of
Volkan and his dwarven smiths.

Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s



This stonework tunnel ends at the precipice of a huge
natural rift in the earth. The rocky ceiling is only twenty
feet above you, but the rift drops away into a fathomless black depth. Veins of silvery ore can be seen in
the sides of the shaft. Ancient mining equipment lines
the walls, but the wooden platforms and walkways are
rotten and unusable. Chains are attached to the ceiling
of the shaft in a pulley system that used to lift ore from
the depths. Most of the chains are rusted and many
have broken. The area around you has been scored by
gouges in the stone, as if some giant claw once reached
out of the pit.


There is nothing living here, but it has an ominous feel
to it. There used to be wooden platforms that allowed
dwarves to mine the mithral and adamantine, but most
are gone and anything that remains is unusable. There
are also pulley systems and ore pails along the sides.
There is an entrance to the second level 100 ft. down
the shaft, but the only way to reach it is to climb the
sheer face of the shaft. Doing so requires three successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks. Someone who
manages this could use pitons and rope to create an
easier path for everyone else.
The shaft goes down for a mile, becoming increasingly
hot before ending in a huge cavern filled with noxious
gas. Stalagmites, stalactites and a fiery red glow give it
the appearance of some kind of hell.
Falling to the bottom inflicts 70 (20d6) bludgeoning
damage. Every round spent in the gas-filled cavern
requires a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid
being poisoned. This is actually an entrance to the
Underdark which empties into a lake of magma. What
lies beyond the lake is outside the scope of this book.

F18. The Dwarven Elevator




This room seems to be some sort of dwarven elevator.
It is a ten-foot metal cube crafted from bronze, with
leering dragon heads engraved into the walls. The
dragons are depicted with snarling mouths.


This elevator leads 100 feet down to the Mithral Forge
area, but it's deadly to anyone who doesn't know the
required password. The password is the word "dragon"
in dwarvish (the troglodyte king knows this). The elevator is an elaborate and deadly fire trap:
Triggering the Trap. Inside the elevator is a lever
to activate it. Once engaged, the elevator begins to
descend. It takes 5 rounds to descend all the way.



• On the second round, all heroes inside must roll for

initiative. On initiative count 20 of the second round,
black oil is pumped into the room from the mouths of
the dragon heads on the top of the elevator.
• On the third round, the roar of flames can be heard
from below and oil continues to be pumped into the
room.
• On initiative count 10 of the fourth round, flames
pour through mouths of the dragon heads on the sides
of the room, igniting the oil. Anyone in the elevator
takes 21 (6d6) fire damage at the end of the fourth
round and the fifth round. The damage is reduced by
7 (2d6) if the oil was blocked before initiative count 10
of round 3 and by a further 7 (2d6) if blocked before
initiative count 10 of the second round.
• At the end of the fifth round, the fire dissipates, and
the elevator doors open with a bell chime.
Disabling the Trap. The trap can be disabled by
speaking the command word at any time, or by jamming
the mouths of the dragons, to prevent the flames from
coming through. If the dragon heads are jammed, they
glow fiery red, and the heat is intense.
The heroes can pull the lever to take the elevator back
to the upper levels. Descending again will restart the
trap mechanism.

F19. The Armory






The armory was ransacked long ago and all that remains
is rotten wood, refuse, bones, and broken equipment.
The armor and weapons are of exquisite make, but they
have been rendered useless by centuries of neglect.
Treasure
There is a mithral xiphos +1 buried under the refuse. It
is covered in a layer of dirty grime and corrosion. It can
be located with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check or with the detect magic spell.

F20. The Lava Pool




This room is dominated by a large circular vat of
molten lava in the center. Something is swimming
beneath the bubbling magma. An ornate bronze sphere
stands close to the lava pool. The sphere is supported
by four legs and has a spout that faces toward the lava.

THE MITHRAL FORGE

This is the central part of the Mithral Mines, where
the dwarves forged the magical items used by the
Dragonlords to defeat the armies of the Titans. The
most obvious way to get down to the armory is by using
the elevator, but it is also possible to reach the armory
by climbing down the main shaft.



This room is lined with iron racks for holding weapons
and armor. Almost all of the racks have been tipped
over, and the only weapons and armor that remain are
broken or corroded. Bones and refuse lay in piles in the
corners of the room.





There are two death dogs that rest here. They sit by the
bronze device, but they don't do anything except growl
at the heroes. If anyone tries to touch the bronze sphere,
the death dogs attack.

The Forgekeeper. In the lava pool is the Forgekeeper,
a salamander. She swims in the lava pool and is willing to talk to the heroes. She explains that the bronze
device has been configured to keep her from escaping
by blasting the area with cold unless it's disabled. It
was designed by the dwarves who originally built the
forge. The Forgekeeper is aware of the history of the
entire place and is willing to share the information if the
heroes promise to disable the sphere. The Forgekeeper
also knows the password to the elevator.
Triggering the Trap. Should the Forgekeeper leave
the lava pool before the bronze sphere device is deactivated, it makes a clicking noise and anyone in the room
is suddenly struck by the effect of a cone of cold spell for
36 (8d8) cold damage. This cold blast repeats every five
rounds until the bronze device is disabled.
Disabling the Trap. The device can be disabled by
smashing the sphere (AC 18, 30 HP). When smashed,
the sphere will release its magic across the entire room,
inflicting 36 (8d8) cold damage on everyone present. A
successful DC 15 Investigation check will reveal that the
device can be jammed. If jammed, the device makes a
grinding noise every round for five rounds, and then the
trap triggers as normal.
The Forgekeeper's Contract
Negotiating with the Forgekeeper will bring the attention
of the young cerberus hound in the other room. The
hound will enter the room and attack with the death dogs.
Once freed, the Forgekeeper thanks the heroes. She
has been imprisoned for centuries and fosters a burning hatred for all dwarves. She will treat dwarves in the
party with hostility. The dwarves summoned her to the
mortal world and then bound her within their forge.
She not only powered the forge, but also used her
skills as a metalsmith to help the god Volkan craft many
powerful mithral and adamantine items. She must
remain for five centuries unless the contract that bound
her is destroyed. She thinks that the tablet bearing the
contract is kept in the Blast Furnace (F21). She knows
how to restart the forge and is willing to do so if the
party agrees to release her from her contract.
If the heroes give the Forgekeeper the contract, she
will melt it. However, instead of immediately returning
to the Plane of Fire, she will remain for one year and
forge items for the heroes. The heroes can try to coerce
the Forgekeeper with the contract tablet, but the results
are always the same.

F21. The Blast Furnace




This room appears to be a dead blast furnace. Four
large stone vats are lined up against the walls. Spouts
extend from the walls over the top of the vats. At the
center of the room, there is a 3 ft. wide circular hole.




This is where mithral ore was melted down into ingots.
The blast furnace is guarded by a young cerberus
hound. He is intelligent enough to hold a conversation
with the heroes. He claims to be a servant of Lutheria,
the Mistress of Death.
The hound's mother was killed a few years ago by a
great beast from the bowels of the earth. He took her
place by devouring a half-dozen of his brothers and
sisters. He won't talk for long, because he's very, very
hungry. He has three mouths to feed, after all!
Treasure. The cerberus hound has gathered some of
the dwarves' ancient treasure. Coins totaling 56 pp, 125
gp, and 389 sp are gathered in a corner. There is also an
adamantine trident and six adamantine javelins. The
rune tablet that keeps the Forgekeeper bound to the
Mithral Mine is part of this treasure hoard.
Event: Awakening the Forge
Only the Forgekeeper can awaken the Forge. Once the
cerberus hound is defeated, she tells the heroes to wait,
then slithers down a hole in the floor. Five rounds later,
she returns from the same hole. Lava bubbles from the
hole and begins to flow in rivulets through the room.
Anyone with a passive Perception of 15 or higher hears
the dwarven elevator activating.
There are multiple levers throughout this area which
can be used to tip a cauldron of molten lava or to cause
jets of fire to blow out from vents.
Cauldron Traps. Choose two spaces on the map.
These spaces are where the cauldrons will dump lava,
doing 28 (8d6) fire damage to anyone in the space.
Fire Vent Traps. Choose two spaces on the map.
These spaces are where vents of fire will erupt, doing
14 (4d6) fire damage to anyone in a 15 ft. line from the
opening of the vent.
Encounter: The Troglodyte Horde
If the heroes have not defeated the troglodyte king, then
awakening the Forge summons a horde of troglodytes to
attack the forge area. One minute after the Forgekeeper

awakens the forge, noises can be heard from the direction of the dwarven elevator. The Forgekeeper will
tell them that the sounds are similar to that made by a
"strange and disgusting beast" that came to visit her a
year ago. She describes the King of the Troglodtyes and
explains that she gave him the password to the elevator.
At this point, the heroes must roll for initiative. On
initiative count 10 of the first round, the elevator door
opens and a dozen troglodytes, four troglodyte brutes,
and the troglodyte king emerge. The king will send
four stealthy troglodytes to scout out ahead of them. He
plans to kill all of the heroes. The Forgekeeper provides
hints as to how the party can use the forge's many traps
against the filthy creatures.

F22. The Secret Dock


This room is a dock that is large enough for most ships.
A beautifully carved bronze lever extends from the wall.
It can be used to activate a stonework dam at the top
of the river that creates a gap in the waterfall. Once the
heroes have the Ultros, they may use this lever to dock
beneath the waterfall and return to the Mithral Forge.

Using the Mithral Forge
Refer to the Treasures appendix for information about
how the heroes can make use of the Mithral Forge.
If the heroes make a deal with the Forgekeeper and
discover the docks, then they can easily return to the
Forge. The Forgekeeper will work with Volkan to make
items from any components that they bring. The dock
is well hidden and has been forgotten by everyone, so it
makes a good hiding place for any ship that the heroes
might have, including the Ultros.

This chamber leads to a secret dock, which is located
behind the Great Falls. The stone dock extends behind
the thundering waterfall. The room is filled with rotting
sacks, barrels, and boxes. There is an ornate bronze
lever on the far side of the room.

The Mossy Temple
Deep within the Oldwoods lies a ruined temple complex covered in a thick layer of moss and surrounded by
massive trees. No one knows who built the temple, but the
Druids of Oldwood believe that it is the oldest structure
in the Heartlands. They maintain a circle of standing
stones nearby, hoping to appease the spirits that haunt the
temple. None who enter the temple have ever returned.

The History of the Temple
The temple's true name is lost to history. It was built
thousands of years ago by an ancient race of six-armed
cyclops called the gygans. It honors Sydon, and it
harkens to a time long before the mortal races arrived
in Thylea. During this period, the gygans were devout
servants of the Titans. They propitiated Sydon with
great sacrifices, earned his favor, and their empire
spanned all the islands of Thylea. The gygans were
thought to have been exterminated by Pythor and the
Dragonlords by the end of the First War.

Arkelander chopped down her sister's oak tree to use
as the mast for his ship, the Ultros. Demetria went mad
with grief for her sister. She swore fealty to Lutheria,
who embraced her and further stoked her rage.
Demetria loathes mortals. She captures young men
and women to serve in Lutheria's dark rituals, telling
them that they are being initiated into an ancient priesthood. In actuality, the women are transformed into
monstrous maenads, while the men are slaughtered and
devoured in ritual feasts.
In the past year, Demetria has become more brazen.
She has captured dozens of teenagers now. Recently,
she sent her goatlings to steal the Horn of Balmytria, in
order to feed her growing number of servants.

Quest: The Horn of Balmytria


Demetria, the Vengeful Dryad
Recently, teenagers have been disappearing from the
towns and farms around Estoria. They are lured into the
forest by roving bands of goatlings that serve the mistress of the temple, a dryad named Demetria.
Demetria has good cause to hate the people of Mytros
and Estoria. Centuries ago, the Dragonlord Estor



As the Oracle's Chosen, you know that one of your
Great Labors is to drink from the Horn of Balmytria. But
the horn has been stolen from the Dragon Shrine by a
tribe of goatlings. They've carried it south from Estoria
into the Oldwoods, and they haven't been very careful.
The trail is marked by haphazard splashes of red wine
which run all the way through the forest.

THE OLDWOODS



The forest grows dark around you, with barely any light
making its way through the canopy. You hear birds and
beasts clamoring beyond every bush, and eventually,
the path you are following seems to disappear into
the underbrush. You emerge into a dimly-lit clearing,
surrounded on all sides by oak trees.
The forest suddenly grows quiet. You can hear
something crashing through the brush ahead of you.
A young girl bursts into the clearing, breathing hard.
Tears streak her dirt-caked face. She looks stunned to
see you. "You... are you really there? Please help!"
You hear more crashing sounds from the forest as
six hideous creatures emerge into the clearing. They
are six goat-headed creatures with cloven hooves.
One of them laughs harshly. "Give us the sweetling.
We've had dinner, but she'll make a fine dessert!"

The Oldwoods is an ancient forest that lies in the center
of the Heartlands, surrounded on all sides by fields and
farms. It is a forest consisting mostly of ancient oak
and walnut trees. For the first century, the new settlers
to Thylea cut down trees to build their farms, towns
and cities. But they stopped when they reached the
Oldwoods because fey creatures are known to haunt
the forest. In the modern daytimes, no one enters the
Oldwoods except for the Druids.
Traveling to the edge of the Oldwoods only takes a
few hours. Traveling within the Oldwoods to the Mossy
Temple takes the better part of a day. Tracking the goatlings requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom check.

Encounter: Tribe of Goatlings
Following the trail of the goatlings, the heroes eventually
come to a shadowy clearing in the woods.



The six goatlings attack the heroes before they can
respond. Three of them will use mockery. Roleplay the
taunts that they hurl at the heroes.

Curing Herkus. If Herkus is ever cured of his insanity, he will thank the heroes profusely. With his mind
returned to him, Herkus turns out to be a very talkative
gnome. He is one of the Druids of Oldwood. Demetria
poisoned him with a tea made from a flower that grows
in the ancient glade.

• "Get lost, you pathetic starvelings!"
• "Your face inspires me... to vomit!"
• "You are a plague-sore on the ass of a pig!"
• "Bald legs! Bald legs! Bald legs!"
• "Fish-faced assassins of joy!"

Herkus the Helpful
When Herkus transforms back into a gnome, he stares at
the heroes with a dazed expression. He then starts eating
leaves and nuts, and without a greater restoration spell, he
remains insane. However, if the heroes enter the temple,
he follows and returns to his squirrel form. He sits on the
shoulder of the hero who attacked or captured him. He
shrieks and throws nuts (that he stores in his cheeks) at
enemies during fights.
Herkus has the statistics of a druid with the following additions. His size is small, and he has darkvision,
speed 25 ft. and gnome cunning: He has advantage on
all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws
against magic. He also has the ability to polymorph into a
beast of CR 1/2 or lower twice per day.

Quest: Corinna's Friends
Corinna (NG scout) is the daughter of Thericles, who
works the vineyards in Estoria (E13). She and her friends
were lured into the temple by a beautiful woman named
Demetria, who promised wealth, beauty, and fame.
Corinna was warned to leave the temple by a young
satyr named Loreus, who said that she and her friends
would soon be doomed to a fate worse than death. She
fled the temple, but the goatlings pursued her.
If the party asks about the Horn of Balmytria, Corinna
confirms that the horn is in the temple. She warns the
party that Demetria is unspeakably beautiful, and has
a way with words that makes everyone fall in love with
her. Nevertheless, she wants to save her friends, so she is
determined to accompany the heroes into the temple.

THE TEMPLE EXTERIOR

T2. The Temple Entrance


T1. The Standing Stones




This clearing is dominated by seven large standing
stones, each about twice the height of a man. The
canopy is less thick here, allowing dappled light to
pass through its rustling branches. Small creatures
occasionally dart through the carpet of leaves blanketing the ground.
Each of the standing stones is covered in splotches
of fuzzy green moss. They are arranged in a half-circle,
and they are cold to the touch. You sense that they
have been here for a very long time.





These standing stones were erected by the druids of the
Oldwood more than a thousand years ago. If a druid
or ranger takes a short rest while within 10 feet of the
standing stones, it will count as a long rest instead. This
only works once per 24-hour period.
Herkus the gnome (CG druid) hides near the standing stones in the form of a squirrel. Herkus is completely insane. As a squirrel, he chatters at the heroes
madly. He jumps from stone to stone and then throws
nuts at them. He will jump on them and try to bite
them. He will only transform back into a gnome if he is
captured or damaged.



The clearing grows wider as you continue eastward.
Ruined architecture seems to suddenly loom over
you. You realize that what you thought were trees are
actually towering pillars of fluted marble, overgrown
with vines and green moss. The columns stand in
two rows, marching toward a massive stone temple
facade. The ruins are worn with unfathomable age,
and several of the pillars toppled and shattered centuries ago.
Dozens of gargantuan tree roots wind their way
through the clearing, climbing over fallen pillars and
rupturing the walls of the temple.


There are a few ways into the inner chambers of the
temple. No one guards the temple, but the roots of the
ancient oaks can be animated by Demetria. She can
use a bonus action to cause one of the roots to attack
any creature within reach. The roots can discern race,
so Demetria can allow certain races, such as satyrs and
goatlings, to come and go as they please.
Animated Roots. Each root has an AC of 10 and 10
HP. Each root can make one attack per round: +3 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning
damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled
(escape DC 10) and restrained until the grapple ends.
The roots have a passive Perception of 14.

The lands were once spotted with countless stone cities
and temples, built by the Gygans. Many were destroyed

adamantine with an AC of 23, 30 HP, and a damage
threshold of 5. Attacking either object will make a loud
echoing noise. Attacking twice will alert the entire complex to the heroes' presence.



THE INNER CHAMBERS
T3. Ruined Antechamber




The temple antechamber is a wide, rectangular room,
shrouded in darkness but for the faint rays of light
coming through the entrance. The room smells wet and
earthy, and the floor is carpeted with soggy dead leaves.






The upper floor of the temple consists of four rooms: the
antechamber, the main worship chamber, the baths, and a
flight of stairs leading into the underground chambers.
Broken Shield. There is a broken bronze shield on
the floor that appears to be centuries old. It bears the
symbol of the Dragonlords. Inscribed along the edge of
the shield are scenes of a dragon-mounted warrior subjugating a race of six-armed cyclopes. The Dragonlord
can be identified as Estor Arkelander with a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (History) check.

T4. The Chamber of Sydon




This chamber is dominated by a beautiful marble
statue of the Titan, Sydon. The Lord of Storms sits
upon his throne, hunching slightly so that his massive
form seems too large for the room. The ceiling is
domed, with an oculus that allows through a broad
ray of light. Sydon holds a large mirror, which catches
the light and directs it through a small shaft that
opens below his feet.


Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s



This room is part of an ancient bath complex. There
are public baths in the city of Mytros, but this one is
far older. The fountains would normally be running at
all times, refreshing the water in the pool, but these
probably haven't worked for centuries.
Stagnant Oozes. The pool water is the domain of two
gray oozes. These gray oozes remain motionless and
invisible at the bottom of the pool. They will only attack
someone who enters the water.
Animated Roots. Demetria has ordered the roots
here to attack anyone except goatlings, satyrs, and maenads. Two roots will attempt to grab and restrain the
heroes. The roots will drag and hold anyone they grapple under the water: refer to the rules on holding your
breath and drowning. Because the roots are beneath
murky water, attacks against them have disadvantage.
Any creature dragged underwater will also be attacked
by the gray oozes.

T6. The Descending Stairway




In the room behind the baths, a stairway descends into
the shadows of the lower floor. The stairs are watched
over by four hideous stone statues. Each appears in the
form of a six-armed cyclops. The statues are missing
arms, legs and heads, and two of them hold discolored
bronze bowls in their lower arms.



This central chamber is quiet. There are no animal
sounds and the statue seems to stare at the heroes.
If Herkus is present in squirrel form, he shrieks and
throws a nut at the statue's head.
Small Shaft. The mirror reflects light into a small
hole in the floor. A Small-sized creature can crawl down
the shaft, which leads to another mirror and then goes
straight down into the Ancient Glade (T8). Someone can
drop down 20 feet into the chamber. They must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or they take 7 (2d6)
bludgeoning damage.
The Statue and Mirror. The statue is made of marble
around a core of adamantine with an AC of 18, 100 HP,
and a damage threshold of 5. The mirror is polished
66



This expansive, rectangular room is shrouded in darkness. You hear the echoing sounds of droplets falling
into a vast pool of deep, stagnant water. Black vines
and massive tree roots climb down the walls and wind
across the room. As you walk forward, the stone floor
gradually descends into the water.





Two of the statues are merely inanimate and will collapse
into dust when touched. The other two statues retain the
magic that animated them as guardians centuries ago.
The statues have the statistics of gargoyles with no fly
speed. They awaken and attack when an intruder starts to
descend the stairway. However, should someone place an
offering in the bowl held by one of the statues and say a
short prayer to Sydon, the statues will remain inanimate.
Suspicious Footprints. The stairs are marked by
dozens of hoofprints and human footprints, some of
which track through haphazard splashes of red wine.

THE ANCIENT GLADE

The Ancient Tree Stump

The ancient glade was a natural cavern that the gygans
built over. The gygans' mirror system lets light into the
cavern and allows the rare plants to grow. The natural cavern has a ceiling that is 20 ft. in height, while
the worked stone tunnels and chambers are 10 ft. in
height.



T7. Tunnel of Roots

This was a sacred tree to the fey of Oldwood, but the
Dragonlord Estor led a band deep into the forest and
chopped it down. He carved the tree up and used it for
the mast, keel, and prow of the Ultros.
Demetria's Sister. This was once the sacred tree of
Demetria's sister, another dryad. Demetria keeps a small
clay pot with her sister's ashes resting on the top of the
stump. If opened, the ashes smells of roses. If Demetria
discovers that anyone has touched the ashes, she will be
determined to kill that individual.



This massive stump must have belonged to a magnificent tree, centuries ago. It was cruelly hewn down to
waist-height. Thousands of green clovers grow over
the ancient injury.




This tunnel leads deeper below the earth. Stone archways support a low ceiling of rocky dirt. Curtains of
heavy roots and vines hang down from the archways,
blocking your view of the way forward.




The roots do nothing when they are first encountered.
However, if Demetria attempts to flee through the
tunnel, she can use these roots to restrain the heroes.

• Ethereum Plant. This can be harvested in order to


This expansive cave is a garden of strange ferns,
fragrant flowers, and luminescent fungi. A massive
tree stump sits in the center, overgrown by a carpet of
green clovers. A stream of clear water winds around
the trunk, babbling noisily. Light streams in from an
opening in the stone ceiling. The air is pleasantly damp,
and the smell of the garden is intoxicating.


This cavern is used as a place to grow rare plants of various kinds. It is moist and is fed by a small underground
stream. The mirror system reflects light down a small
shaft into the underground glade. This is how the rare
plants get sunlight.
Encounter: Sostrate
Two goatlings chase a young man around the glade.
He shrieks when they grab at him, but they always
release him so that they can resume the chase.
Four other goatlings are currently hidden and watching from the shadows. The boy, Sostrate (NG commoner), is one of Corinna's friends. If the heroes do not
intervene, the 'game' will eventually end in his death.
If the goatlings see the heroes, they will first try to
finish off Sostrate and then attack the heroes. Roll for
initiative and make the intent of the goatlings clear.
Any goatling who is damaged before his first round
will shift his target to the heroes. If Herkus is on a
hero's shoulder, he will throw a nut and draw the ire
of one of the goatlings. If Corinna is present, she will
rush forward to save Sostrate. The four goatlings
hidden in shadows will attack anyone who moves in to
save Sostrate.



Garden of Strange Plants
There are also several rare and useful plants here:

create the poison, essence of ether. It takes an hour
to harvest enough of the plant to make a single dose.
There are enough plants in the chamber for 12 doses.
Proficiency with the Poisoner's Kit is required.
• Aconite. This can be harvested in order to make the
poison, assassin's blood. It takes two hours to harvest
enough of the plant to make a single dose. There are
enough aconite plants in the chamber for 12 doses.
Proficiency with the Poisoner's Kit is required.
• Sunril Berry Bush. The berries from this legendary
bush have the same effect as goodberries. Thirty berries
can be harvested from the bush. The berries are easy to
harvest, but they will spoil in 24 hours.

T9. Cavern of Fungus




This cavern is blanketed with luminescent pink and
teal-colored mushrooms. The walls are hewn from
smooth rock, and they slope upward from the ground,
leaving many comfortable spots to recline. A stream of
water from the adjoining glade flows into a stone basin
in the floor.




This cavern is filled with the Madon fungus which
doesn't require sunlight to grow. The Madon is famed
for its use in the making of the truth serum poison.
It is also used as a recreational drug. When eaten, it
causes a state of euphoria that lasts for hours.
Goatlings. A pair of goatlings hide at the back of the
cave. They attack the heroes as soon as they see them.
Teenage Revelers. There are currently eight teenage
men and women in the cavern chamber. They have all
been eating the Madon fungus and are in a euphoric
Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s

69

state: they are considered to be poisoned for the next
two hours. All of them are under the sway of Demetria
and are awaiting their turn to be 'initiated'.
The teenagers cannot be convinced that Demetria
is anything other than a benevolent goddess who has
promised her devoted followers wealth, beauty, and
fame. If separated from Demetria for 24 hours, they
can be persuaded of the nymph's true intent with a
successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
The teenagers have the stats of commoners and are
divided into pairs: Lysandra and Bassilus, Kleon and
Heron, Irene and Draco, Callisto and Ariston.
Grasping Roots. There are two roots close to the
entrance to the cave. These roots will attempt to grapple
anyone trying to leave the cave.

Loreus the Satyr

Making Truth Serum
Heroes with proficiency in Nature will recognize the
Madon fungus and realize its usefulness in making the
truth serum poison (see the Game Master's Guide).
Proficiency in Medicine is required to recognize that
the fungus needs to be harvested in a particular way
to avoid spoiling its effectiveness. Every hour spent
harvesting the fungus gives enough material to make
a single dose of truth serum poison. There is enough
harvestable fungus for 12 doses.

Loreus the Lovestruck
Loreus will stealthily follow the heroes while they remain
in the Mossy Temple. If they are in danger he will use his
pan pipes to put one enemy to sleep. If the heroes try to
leave him behind, he will be heartbroken. In this case,
Loreus will show up again in Mytros, with a random trinket as a gift for each of the heroes.

T10. Den of Lush Flowers




This small cavern is overgrown with living roots and
vines. Flowers of every shape, scent and color carpet
the floor, overwhelming your senses. Several oak trees
also grow, breaking upward through the partially-collapsed ceiling. A stream of water from the adjoining
glade trickles through here.




This cavern is the resting place for some of the fey who
have come to visit Demetria. There are two satyrs and
one dryad, who have come to plead with her to stop
antagonizing the mortals. Harmless pranks are one
thing, but kidnapping young mortals is dangerous. They
worry about a reprisal from Estoria.
Fey Diplomacy. The satyrs and dryad won't harm the
heroes, but they won't help them either. They will simply
inform the heroes that Demetria rules the temple, that
her actions are her own, and that she doesn't represent
the other fey of the forest. They would be pleased if
Demetria were no longer a problem in Oldwood.
Encounter: Loreus the Satyr
Loreus (CG satyr) is also here, and he is very interested
in the heroes. He is quite talkative, and he asks many
questions about their purpose in the temple. Loreus is
different from most of his kind and has an intense curiosity about the settler races.
70

Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s

Demetria's History. Loreus explains that Demetria
was consumed with a desire for revenge after her sister
was killed by Estor Arkelander, five hundred years ago.
She sought out Lutheria and formed a dark pact with the
Titan, vowing to cast a shadow over the Oldwoods, to
make the mortal races remember their fear of the dark.
Lovestruck Satyr. Loreas is driven by his emotions,
both good and bad. If one of the heroes shows him even
an ounce of kindness, he will fall in love with them.
Loreus will stealthily follow his new love when they
leave the cave. While Loreus doesn't know details of the
maenad initiation feast, he suspects foul play and urges
the heroes to investigate the kitchens.

T11. Stone Corridor



This torch-lit corridor descends for about one hundred
paces. The walls are decorated with ancient, colorful
mosaics, which depict vignettes of six-armed warriors,
farmers and priests.

This corridor is usually empty.

THE FEASTING HALLS

T12. Nursing Chamber




This small stone chamber has been made warm and
comfortable with feathered pillows and animal skins.
A bronze lantern hangs from the ceiling, bathing the
room with flickering golden light. Aromatic incense
smoke rises from a brass censer, although this doesn't
quite disguise the smell of goats.


The feasting halls are chambers of worked stone built by
the gygans more than a millennium ago. The ceilings are
15 ft. in height, and the walls are cyclopean stonework.

T14. Kitchens




There are two maenads present in this chamber with
their goatling children. The maenads are drinking wine,
eating mushrooms, and feeding their children the same.
When the maenads spot the heroes, they demand to
know who they are, while the goatlings will growl and
hiss. If the heroes can come up with a convincing lie, a
successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check will put
the maenads back at ease. In this case, they invite the
party to enjoy their wine and mushrooms.
Frenzied Maenads. If the heroes don't immediately
provide a satisfactory lie, then the maenads will enter a
frenzy of drunken bloodlust and attack.
Baby Goatlings. The four young goatlings carry small
knives for cutting mushrooms. The goatlings have AC
10 and 1 HP each. They threaten the heroes with their
knives, but they are too timid to attack.



T15. Feast Hall




This round chamber looks to be a warm and comfortable sleeping chamber with feather pillows and animal
skins. Four young men and women sleep upon the skins.


There are four teenagers sleeping in this chamber. Their
names are Nikon, Markos, Theophania, and Phokas.
They have the stats of commoners and behave in the
same way as the teenagers from the Cavern of Fungus
(T9), although they are not poisoned.
Grasping Roots. There are two roots close to the
entrance to the cave. These roots will attempt to grapple
anyone who tries to leave the room without Demetria's
permission. As with other roots, they do nothing to
those who are entering the chamber.

Demetria saw the truth of things: the Dragonlords
may have been saviors to their people, but they
despoiled the lands of Thylea with their lust for
battle and conquest. It was wise of the dryad
to seek justice from the Lady of Dreams, who is
gracious and good to her servants.
- Chondrus, Priest of Lutheria



This feasting hall is dominated by a huge table shaped
from living oak. The table has enough chairs to seat a
dozen guests. Food and wine are artfully arranged on
the tabletop. A beautiful silver dragon horn with gold
fittings sits at the center of the table.







This is where the food is prepared. Currently the
slaughtered carcasses of four teenage boys are being
prepared for the feast in the feast hall. The cooks are
two goatlings. They will continue with their task
unless attacked by the heroes. The horrific nature
of the feast is revealed with a successful DC 15
Intelligence (Investigation) check.

T13. The Sleeping Chamber




This chamber is filled with the smell of roasting meat.
It is a kitchen of sorts, with stone and wooden tables
for preparing food. A large bronze oven dominates the
north wall, blasting the room with heat.



This is a feasting chamber with a giant table, beautifully laid out with wine and food. Reflected light pours
in from the mirrors.
Demetria (CE dryad) is here with four adoring teenage girls. They are preparing for the initiation feast.
Loyal Gygan. Demetria's gygan servant is nine feet
tall, and he looms in the background. He has a single
eye (like a cyclops), six powerful arms, and a number of
weapons and shields. He's also very clever, although he
doesn't speak much. Sydon has charged him with both
protecting and watching over Demetria.
Epic Paths: Meeting Demetria
Demetria has information pertinent to both the Doomed
One and the Haunted One. Refer to the Running the Epic
Paths section for details.

The dryad invites the heroes to sit down and join the
feast. She is granting her best student a special prize-a
shortbow of cupidity. She will playfully accuse the heroes
of spoiling a special moment for her acolytes.
The Dryad's Appeal. As long as the heroes don't
initiate combat, Demetria is happy to talk. She knows
Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s

71

that the heroes have been chosen by the Oracle, but she
dismisses their quest as an impossible one. She extolls
Sydon's strength and Lutheria's beauty. She speaks of the
cruelty of the Dragonlords, explaining that her sister lost
her life to the wickedness of Estor Arkelander. She asks
the heroes whether they are truly fighting for the right
side in the looming conflict. She then invites them to
share the meal with her and the girls.
A Grisly Feast. The feast consists of the cooked
bodies of the young men who were paired with the girls
at the table. If the heroes are aware of this, then they can
convince the girls with a successful DC 15 Persuasion
check (an automatic success if Corinna is with them).
If Herkus is with the heroes, he will transform into
his gnome form, sniff the air, and declare that the meat
smells like cooked human flesh.
The Ritual is Completed
Eating the human flesh has no ill effects on any of the
heroes, but if they cannot dissuade the girls from partaking in the feast, then Demetria's ritual is completed,
and the girls are transformed into four maenads:




Demetria smiles at the girls as they hungrily devour
the feast. "I'm glad to see that you have such appetites! There's nothing more delicious than a lover's
flesh, is there?"
Suddenly, the girls begin to shriek in pain. Their
teeth sharpen, the bones in their legs snap backwards,
and horns grow from their heads. In a matter of seconds, they have all been transformed into monstrous
maenads.
Demetria gently pets one of her new servants.
"Shush now, my sweetlings. This is a great blessing.
Now, you shall have the pleasure to serve Lutheria for
the rest of your lives. And you can start by slaughtering
these uninvited guests!"


T16. Demetria's Chambers




Treasure
Demetria keeps her valuables locked in a trunk. The
lock can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity
check with thieves' tools. Inside are trinkets and other
items stolen from the teenagers she has kidnapped. This
haul includes two necklaces worth 100 gp each. There
are also four rings worth 50 gp each and a half dozen
gems of different sorts each worth 50 gp.
Ritual Tome. The most important item is a tome
bound in human skin. Inside is a description written
by Lutheria herself on the ritual of transformation that
turns a human woman into a maenad.

The Horn of Balmytria
Once the heroes have secured the Horn of Balmytria,
they are expected to drink from it. They may choose to
do this as soon as they recover it, or they may wait.
Drinking even a small amount of wine from the horn
for the first time sends the heroes into a deep sleep for
8 hours. The heroes experience vivid dreams during
this sleep:


Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s



You are standing on the deck of a beautiful galley.
A bright cerulean sea stretches out before you. You
look down at a strange bronze device in your hands.
It seems to reflect the constellations of the night sky,
even though the sun shines brightly overhead.
The oarsmen pull the ship through the water faster
than you thought possible. You look down at the men
on the benches. They meet your gaze with dead eyes
and skeletal faces-dozens of leering corpses.
You are startled awake.



The Ritual is Disrupted
Revealing the true nature of the meal to the girls will
infuriate them so that they attack Demetria, restraining
her for three rounds. The gygan will easily kill the girls
unless the heroes intervene.
If the heroes attack Demetria before the ritual is
completed, then the girls will scream and hide, while the
gygan will defend Demetria. They fight to the death.

72



Demetria spends most of her time in these chambers,
enjoying the company of love-besotted teenagers. She
lures them here before using them in her evil rituals.

At this point, Demetria will order everyone to attack the

The Ghost Ship
There is only one ghost ship known to the people of
Thylea, the Ultros. This is the famous trireme constructed by the Dragonlords, five centuries ago. It was
commanded by a bloodthirsty man, Estor Arkelander

who was responsible for starting the First War. He was
later cursed to sail the seas forever as a ghost.
The only person who is likely to know the location
of the Ultros is King Acastus of Mytros, for he is a
descendant of Estor Arkelander.
The Strange Device
The bronze construct from the dream may be the
legendary magical compass known as the Antikythera.
Supposedly, it has the power to navigate to all of the
islands in the Cerulean Sea, the Forgotten Sea, and even
the legendary Nether Sea. It's uncertain where this item
might be found, but it's useless without the ship.

The Necropolis at Telamok
Telamok is a sacred site built alongside a canyon in the
Mithral Mountains. The mountain and its ruins are
named after the ancient Dragonlord, Telamok.
Ancient, time-worn bridges cross a vast mistshrouded chasm to cliffs where the entrances to tombs
and crypts are located. This is a place of death where no
living being stirs. The ruins are covered by a thin layer of
snow and ice, which absorbs sound and enshrouds the
area in an eerie silence.
Deathly Silence
When describing the journey to the Necropolis, you should
emphasize the silence. The snow absorbs much of the
sound. The skeletons and specters make no sound when
attacking. Damon does not speak. The only creature in the
entire necropolis that speaks is the minotaur Graxis.

Armaments of the Dragonlords
One of the party's Great Labors requires them to
recover the armaments of the Dragonlords. Xander's
armaments are still located in his crypt. The Axe of
Xander and the Shield of Volkan have been looted by the
minotaur Graxis, while the Breastplate of Mytros is still
on the corpse of Xander in his sarcophagus.

TRAVELING TO THE
NECROPOLIS
Encounter: Arms of Kentimane


The History of the Necropolis
The Necropolis was built to house the remains of
the Dragonlords who came to Thylea five centuries
ago. Xander Huorath, the first and greatest of the
Dragonlords, is buried at the center of the Necropolis.
In addition to the Dragonlords, the skeletal remains of
Balmytria, the silver dragon, are entombed here.
This 'city of the dead' is regarded as a sacred place, forbidden to anyone except other Dragonlords. It is guarded
by Damon, a lich. He was Xander's friend and the most
powerful wizard of his day. Since he achieved undeath, he
has seen all of his friends pass into the afterlife and now
makes sure no one loots the city's treasures.



At first, your journey across the great plains of Thylea
is an uneventful one. The road to the Necropolis at
Telamok is well maintained but little traveled. As the
Mithral Mountains drift into sight, you encounter a
scene that is almost beyond comprehension. Dozens of
massive stone arms reach out of the ground, dwarfing
everything around you for a mile.
The arms are motionless and seemingly have no purpose. This alien sight invites unnerving questions: what
are the arms for? Who created them? Are they alive?




These statues are the arms of Kentimane, the HundredHanded Titan. They cannot be damaged and they will
not move against the heroes.

The Path of the Dead




This path leads upwards into the Mithral Mountains. It
is commonly known as the Path of the Dead, because it
is the only way to reach the Necropolis at Telamok.
It is utterly quiet. There are no bird calls, no insects,
no animal life at all. Even the sound of the wind is
missing in the dead air. It grows colder as the path
gains height, and a light covering of snow begins to
coat the path. The path is narrow and treacherous.
Just past the edge, the ground falls away for hundreds
of feet.
The silence is suddenly ended by a song... A song so
beautiful that it makes your heart ache with desire.


who climbs down to the valley floor is immediately
swarmed by skeletons, minotaur skeletons, and
specters.
The initial fight is against 1d4 skeletons, but after two
rounds, another 1d4 skeletons and one minotaur skeleton will join the fight. Then, after another two rounds,
1d4 skeletons and one specter. After that, 1d4 specters
will join every round. Trying to climb up from the valley
to the Necropolis is difficult-the sheer cliffs are 500
feet high. For the first 100 feet, anyone trying to climb
will be harassed by specters.

KEY LOCATIONS
X1. The Approach




The ancient Necropolis stands before you, awe-inspiring in both size and splendor. Although ice and snow
obscure the details, its magnificent pillars and statues
surround a massive stone structure.
Between you and the Necropolis is a vast canyon
spanned by three stone bridges. Two of the bridges are
apparently broken and unusable. Although the bottom
of the canyon is cloaked in mist, you can see a number
of bones scattered among the rocks below.
The canyon is shrouded in an eerie silence. The only
sound that can be heard is your feet crunching through
a light layer of frost and snow on the paved path.

Partway up the mountain, three harpies begin to
harass the heroes. They have nested on the cliff opposite the mountain path, and they use their luring song
to ensnare hapless travelers.
Dangerous Ledge. Those affected by the song will
try to leap the chasm to reach the harpies' nest. Before
making the leap, an affected character can make another
Wisdom saving throw to shake off the charm. Failing
that, they must make a DC 15 Strength check to successfully leap from the path to the nest. Any character
who fails the leap falls 50 feet to a ledge below and
suffers 5d6 bludgeoning damage.

Valleys Shrouded in Mist



The mountain is surrounded by deep valleys that are
forever shrouded in mist. The valleys are empty of
living creatures, but they are patrolled by those who
died in the construction of the Necropolis. Anyone



The approach to the ruins is a paved path, covered
lightly by snow. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival)
check reveals tracks beneath the snow. The tracks look
like they were made by a two-legged bull, and they run
to and from the Necropolis. If the check is made at DC
20 or higher, then the tracker will realize that a powerful
minotaur made the tracks.

X2. Damon The Lich




A lone skeletal figure stands at the center of this
bridge. A tattered cloak covers the figure's thin frame
and obscures its face. Golden runes are traced along
the hems of the cloak. As you draw closer, the figure
holds out a skeletal hand expectantly, as if awaiting
some sort of payment.







Damon (TN lich) was a companion of the original
Dragonlords who sailed across the ocean to Thylea. He
lost everything in the First War, including his wife and
children. He dedicated his life to the defense of the settlers, and now he defends the Necropolis to honor those
who sacrificed their lives to do the same.

Ch apter 2 - The Gr e at L abor s

75

He is now a lich. The Necropolis is considered to be
his lair, and he would be an incredibly difficult opponent
for the heroes. He may use spells such as hold person
and wall of force to prevent a battle, if the heroes are
stupid enough to attack him.
Damon will only allow the party to pass the bridge if
he is given a single burnished dragonlord coin.

THE NECROPOLIS RUINS


Across the bridge, you can see 12 tomb entrances
carved into the cliffs, each marked by four stone
columns. To the north is a great white marble mausoleum, the size of a small palace.
Close to the mausoleum's entrance is a 13th tomb,
much grander than the others, standing alone in a
rocky outcropping away from the cliffs.
You see many bodies lying upon the icy paths that
wind around the ruins. Some are the desiccated,
half-frozen corpses of would-be grave robbers, while
others are statues of various sizes and styles. Their
frozen eyes seem to be watching you.

Paying the Lich
If someone tries to pass without payment, Damon will
use his magic to prevent them crossing. Initially he will
only use wall of force, but he will also use non-lethal spells
and powers such as hold person and paralyzing touch if
necessary. He will fight to the death if threatened.

Anyone who tries to fly to the Necropolis without
payment will be targeted by Damon. The one creature
that Damon allows to pass at will is Graxis the minotaur.
Epic Paths: The Cursed One
If the Cursed One is present, then Damon recognizes them
and gives them a lost family heirloom-a gem of brightness.
He also tells them that they must seek the Lotus Witch.
Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.







The Necropolis is a dangerous place and many of the
threats are too great for low level characters to handle.
However, curious parties may attempt to loot the tombs
anyway. There are various ways to dissuade this: desiccated bodies lay outside many of the tombs, looking as if
they were ripped apart by some beast.
Tomb Exteriors
The tombs are built into cliffs that are about 15 feet
high. Most of the tombs have four marble pillars set into
the cliff face. These pillars are entwined with dragons.
Each tomb entrance is sealed with a chiseled marble
slab measuring 5 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 5 feet thick.
Removing or resetting this stone slab requires an action
and a successful DC 25 Strength check.

X4. The Tomb of Adonis

Warning Inscriptions. Each tomb inscription names
the Dragonlord interred inside, along with a warning:

The inscription on the tomb reads:

"DEATH AWAITS ANY WHO WOULD
desecrate the great warrior within."

ADONIS NEURDAGON
Oathsworn of Pythor
Most beautiful of Dragonlords
If but his sword work had been as beautiful.

Kyrah warns the heroes of the dire consequences of
robbing consecrated tombs. Plundering certain tombs
will subject the heroes to the curse of the graverobber.



Tomb Interiors
Each tomb is the resting place of one Dragonlord. Their
name, epitaph, and the warning are inscribed on the
marble slab that blocks each entrance. Each tomb is a
15 x 15-foot chamber, and each contains a 5 x 8-foot
rectangular marble sarcophagus.
Inside each sarcophagus is a Dragonlord and the
treasure that was buried with them. Early Dragonlords
were buried with mithral and adamantine items but,
after the Mithral Mine was closed, those ores became
rare. Later Dragonlords are buried with bronze items.



The inscription on the tomb reads:
TELAMOK ARKELANDER
Oathsworn of Vallus







Telamok was a particularly vicious Dragonlord, known
for never giving quarter in battle. He was responsible for
some of the worst massacres during the First War, and
was cursed to undeath as a result.
Telamok's Sarcophagus. If his sarcophagus is opened,
Telamok will rise as a wight. He has maximum hit
points (66) and is dressed in a breastplate with a shield
(AC 18). He has a Strength of 20. He will pursue anyone
who breaks into his tomb for one minute. Afterwards,
he will return to his tomb and reseal it.
Treasure
Telamok's mithral breastplate and shield are worth
500 gp each. They are engraved with elaborate dragon
motifs. This tomb is not consecrated.



You hear a snap, followed by a grinding noise
from above you. A stone block falls and seals the
entrance. Silver liquid gushes from the hole in the
roof that held the blocking stone. The quicksilver
reaches your feet and begins to fill the chamber at
an alarming pace.



The inside of the crypt contains a large sarcophagus with a proud warrior engraved on its lid. Fading
murals cover the walls and ceiling of the crypt. They
depict the same warrior, slaughtering enemies of
every kind: men, women, centaurs, satyrs, cyclopes,
and more.




Adonis was a Dragonlord who followed Xander across
the oceans to Thylea. He was not particularly wellliked by his peers, but he was known for his beauty and
extreme wealth. His tomb is a trap. If the sarcophagus is
touched, a block of marble will seal the tomb.

X3. The Tomb of Telamok





A beautiful sarcophagus hewn from bright white
marble stands in the center of the tomb. The lid is
carved with the likeness of a handsome warrior wearing a suit of armor that is more ornamental than practical. Although the carvings that line the walls ostensibly
depict the great battles of the First War, there is a clear
emphasis on the beauty of the dragonrider rather than
his prowess in combat.



Mercury Trap. From the space where the block
dropped, mercury will pour into the chamber-enough
to fill it entirely. It takes three rounds for the tomb to fill
up, and each round, everyone inside must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. At the
start of the fourth round, there is no more air. Use the
drowning rules at this point. Heroes with the ability to
breathe water will still drown in mercury.
Escaping the Trap. The only way to escape is with
brute force. The marble block sealing the tomb must
be moved with a successful DC 30 Strength check, or it
must be destroyed in some way. The marble block has
100 HP, AC 17, and a damage threshold of 5.
Treasure
Adonis is wearing a breastplate +1 and a short sword
of quickness. This tomb is consecrated, so taking either
of these items will afflict the thief with the curse of the
grave robber.

X5. The Tomb of Estor

Treasure
Rizon's mithral breastplate and shield are worth 500 gp
each. She also holds a mithral kopis +1. This tomb is
consecrated, so taking any of these items will afflict the
thief with the curse of the grave robber.

The inscription on the tomb reads:
ESTOR ARKELANDER
Oathsworn of Kyrah




Disturbing images adorn the walls of this tomb. Rather
than heroic battles, the carvings largely depict a man
slaughtering unarmed dryads and satyrs in gory detail.
Clear pain and fear mark his victims' faces. In one
panel, his dragon companion appears to beg for mercy
on behalf of a group of nearby creatures. A blood-red
marble sarcophagus bearing the same man's image sits
in the center of the room.


X7. The Tomb of Cosmo
The inscription on the tomb reads:
COSMO PHOBAS
Son of Rizon Phobas




Estor Arkelander was the brother of Telamok, and one
of the original Dragonlords who came to Thylea five
centuries ago. His body was never interred here. He
still captains the doomed ghost ship, the Ultros, as the
heroes will discover later in the story.
Kyrah's Reaction. Kyrah reacts coldly to the tomb.
She still carries centuries of guilt about the atrocities
committed by Estor during the First War. She has
nothing to say about the tomb, and she has no desire to
linger here any longer than she has to.



Your torchlight seems unable to properly illuminate
the floor, ceiling, and walls, which are covered in a slick
black substance that appears to shift and quiver. The
only object you can clearly make out is a gray marble
sarcophagus with the features of a man.




Cosmo was the first-born son of Rizon. He succeeded
Xander as the leader of the Dragonlords.
The interior walls, floor, and ceiling of the tomb are
black in color and appear to be alive. This is because
they are coated with five black puddings, one on each
wall (but not the entrance wall) and one on the ceiling
and floor. They will attack anyone who enters.
Treasure
Cosmo's adamantine breastplate and shield are worth
500 gp each. This tomb is not consecrated.

Treasure
Estor's sarcophagus is empty.

the likeness of the woman from the murals.


Rizon, a rival of Xander, was one of the riders who came

anyone who enters the chamber.

Two identical clay statues of a handsome man stand
on either side of a gray marble sarcophagus, which is
carved with the same likeness. He can also be seen
throughout the tomb's murals, which depict him as
a man of immense wealth. Inlays of gold, silver, and
precious stones glitter from the murals, all in sharp
contrast to the fading colors that surround them.









Myrto was the grandson of Adonis. He used his family
wealth to bribe the other Dragonlords, so that he would
be elected leader after the death of Cosmo. The two statues of Myrto that flank his sarcophagus are clay golems
that will attack anyone who enters the tomb.
Treasure
Myrto's decorative breastplate and shield are useless
in battle. They are forged from silver, gold, and platinum. They are worth 2,500 gp each. This tomb is not
consecrated.

The sarcophagus of this crypt depicts an athletic
woman of regal bearing. Murals in the tomb show her
competing in foot races, javelin throwing, and other
competitive games. Always at her side is a man in a
cloak that resembles the one worn by the lich that
guards the Necropolis.


Treasure
Lysis's bronze breastplate and shield are inscribed with
platinum and are worth 500 gp each. This tomb is not

X11. The Tomb of Ochos


Isadore was the granddaughter of Xander. Damon
served as her chief advisor when she ruled the
Dragonlords. After she died, Damon retreated from life
in the city of Mytros and came to the Necropolis to be
its guardian, and to watch over Isadore in particular.
Damon's Alarm. Damon has the alarm spell cast
on the tomb. If anyone opens the tomb, the alarm
goes off and the sound of a bell ringing will be heard.
Spellcasters will recognize the sound as the alarm spell
with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A
DC 15 check or higher will reveal that Damon was the
likely caster.
Three rounds after the alarm spell goes off, Damon
will teleport in and use his full range of powers to
destroy anyone still trespassing inside the tomb.
Treasure
Isadore wears a necklace worth 1000 gp and five rings
worth 200 gp each. Beside her body lies a staff of charming. This tomb is consecrated, so taking the staff will
afflict the thief with the curse of the grave robber.

The inscription on the tomb reads:
OCHOS ARKELANDER




A bronze statue of a man stands watch over this tomb.
The murals on the walls of this tomb depict the man
leading an army of hoplites in several clashes against
the centaurs in the grasslands north of the Arkelon
River. The man is shown wearing a simple bronze
breastplate, and his sarcophagus is entirely unadorned.




Ochos is another in the Arkelander family, but he was
a soldier rather than a king. A bronze statue of Ochos
stands behind the sarcophagus. This bronze statue is
actually a golem. Although the golem is made of bronze,
it has all the statistics of an iron golem except that its
AC is 18 rather than 20. The golem attacks anyone who
removes an item from this tomb.

The walls of the tomb display the brutal behavior of a
king with a glint of madness in his eye. The main panel
shows his downfall at the hands of the god, Pythor. At
the center of the tomb is a black marble sarcophagus
carved in the image of the mad king.



Soot darkens the floor and walls of this tomb. An
ornate sarcophagus in the center of the room is carved
with the likeness of a young man, and its lid has been
left slightly ajar. Footprints in the soot suggest that this
crypt has been visited in the recent past.



Lysis was the great grandson of Estor, and he was the
last of his family to rule Estoria. The Arkelanders had
ruled Estoria as kings for over a century, but Lysis
proved to be a mad tyrant who stained the throne with
wanton murder and torture. The god Pythor, unable to
stand by and watch, overthrew him and took the throne.







Dorion Neurdagon was the last of his family to take up
the mantle of Dragonlord. His tomb has been looted.
The soot on the walls is from a fire-based trap that no
longer works. Damon resealed the tomb long ago, but
he could do nothing more. Dorion's body is missing its
head, and there is no treasure in the sarcophagus.

This crypt is empty and has no sarcophagus. The
murals and painted ceiling tell the story of a young man
traversing the islands and waters of Thylea. The man,
however, is absent from the final panel. This simply
shows a grieving woman looking across a stormy sea
from a palace balcony.




Unlike the other tombs, this tomb does not have marble
pillars. The body of Gregor of the Huorath family was
never found. Although his tomb was prepared, it has
always been empty.

Investigation: Tomb Interior


The inscription on the tomb reads:
NICHOLAS PHOBAS
Blessed of Sydon


This tomb is in good condition compared to most of
the others. The murals are bright and the paint has not
completely faded. The images adorning the walls and
sarcophagus depict a man who is equal parts sailor and
king. He wears a breastplate adorned with a maelstrom
swirl, the symbol of Sydon.

Nicholas was the very last of the Dragonlords. He ruled
and died one century ago, though the order had long
been corrupted at that point. In his lifetime, Nicholas
swore fealty to Sydon as a symbolic gesture of peace,
earning the blessing of the Titan. The Order of Sydon
modeled themselves after his example.
Teleportation Trap. This sarcophagus is protected
by magic, and anyone touching it must make a DC
15 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to Sydon's
Throne Room in Praxys (S28) for 1 minute.
Sydon knows that whoever appears before him was
desecrating the tomb of Nicholas Phobas, and he will
use his full power to destroy the impudent tomb raider.
If anyone survives this encounter, they are immediately
teleported back to the tomb. Once activated, this trap
cannot be activated again for a full year.
Treasure
Nicholas has a bronze breastplate and a platinum shield
inscribed with the symbol of Sydon. Each is worth 1,500
gp. There is also a single mithral ingot worth 500 gp.

Unlike most of the art in the Necropolis, the mosaics
that line the walls and ceilings here are pristine, almost
new in appearance. The panel closest to the entrance
depicts five majestic dragons, one silver and four bronze,
soaring through the heavens. A formidable human warrior is mounted on each dragon.
The next mosaic is dominated by the verdant coast
of Thylea. While the bronze dragons remain aloft, the
silver dragon is shown making landfall on this new
continent. Her rider greets a haggard-looking group
of humans on the shore. Subsequent mosaics show
human civilization on the continent blossoming from
tiny towns to great walled cities under the leadership
of the Dragonlords.

This is the largest tomb in the Necropolis, as befits the
burial place of a dragon. Some believe that it houses a
passageway to the Underworld.






This massive tomb dwarfs all of the others in the
Necropolis. The pristine white marble mausoleum is
supported by immense, serpentine pillars. As you draw
closer, you realize that these pillars are actually statues
that have been carved in the shapes of dragons.





A huge marble block rests at the center of the mausoleum. This is where the body of Balmytria is interred.
The block is 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 5 feet high.
The block cannot be moved except by one of the Titans
or by the Five Gods, but none are willing to disturb the
resting place of Balmytria.

THE TOMB OF XANDER

This is the burial tomb of Xander Hourath, the first
Dragonlord. The heroes must enter this tomb to claim
the armaments of the Dragonlords in order to complete
one of their Great Labors.
The tomb is guarded by Graxis, a powerful minotaur.
He is the last of a bloodthirsty tribe that Lutheria created during the First War. After Rizon Phobas defeated
them, Damon cursed the survivors to live forever as
guardians of the Necropolis. Consequently, when these
minotaurs die, they return as undead skeletons.
Graxis refused to share the fate of his kindred. He
murdered them all, just to be safe, and he continues to
stalk the region, searching for fresh meat. He despises
Damon, Xander, and all the Dragonlords.



Graxis the Minotaur

Graxis the Butcher
Graxis is a minotaur hero who uses a shield (AC 19). He
has desecrated the tomb of Xander by plundering the Axe
of Xander and the Golden Shield of Volkan. The axe is dull,
while the shield is dented and pieces are missing. These
don't currently have magical properties, but they can still
be used as normal, non-magical items.
Graxis tries to make hit and run attacks against trespassers in the tomb. He makes a charge attack and then
disengages on the following round. Then he returns to his
lair and eats hungrily to recover lost hit points. He needs
to spend five rounds eating to recover all of his hit points.
Once Xander's sarcophagus has been opened, Graxis will
stop retreating and fight to the death.

X16. The Tomb Entrance




This white marble tomb is carved into the side of the
mountain and sheltered by an imposing portico of
weathered columns. The entrance to the sepulcher is
blocked by a heavy, chiseled slab, flanked by two statues of sitting lions. The center of the slab is fitted with
an inset bronze handle. The pediment above the tomb
is engraved with the name "XANDER" amidst intricate
vines and laurel leaves.


I have no sympathy for the minotaurs. True, they are
not the brutish beasts that the people of Mytros
would have you believe, but all it takes is one
monster wearing skulls for ornaments to show the
world that your kind is not to be trusted.



Xander's tomb is sealed with a marble door that has an
inset bronze handle. It can be pulled open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.
Lesser Tombs. Four lesser tombs are adjacent to
Xander's, for his closest companions and friends. Each
one is sealed by a block of marble measuring 5 feet wide,
5 feet tall, and 5 feet thick. Removing or resetting one of
these blocks requires an action and a successful DC 25
Strength check. There are three names inscribed on the
tombs-Aetius, Pericles, and Eustace.
The last tomb is unlabeled and empty, because it was
built for Damon but never used. Inside the three tombs,
the bodies of Aetius, Pericles, and Eustace are all equipped
with steel breastplates, shields, and short swords. All of the
items are in perfect condition, but none are magical.

and queens granting Xander and his companions the
ships and money needed to embark on a great voyage
of discovery. Next, they show the five dragons making
an alliance with Xander. The central mosaics show the

of conquest against the inhabitants of Thylea, including
the centaurs, minotaurs, and gygans.
An inscription above the stairs reads: "Those who
trespass in order to seek an audience with Xander
Hourath must deal with the horned ones."



This room has a single marble alcove with a burning torch. Stone shelves line the walls, littered with
cobwebs and human skulls. The floor is covered by
a thick blanket of dust. Large, yellowed bones are
scattered around three heavy bronze axes in the
center of the room.

X18. The Catacomb Maze




As you descend into the yawning tunnel below the
stairway, you feel a penetrating cold seep through
your armor and into your bones. The air is choked
with dust, and your footfalls echo through the silence.
After a short distance, you come to a fork in the
tunnel and you must choose which path you will take
to continue onward.






The maze is patrolled by two kinds of enemies.
Skeletons. These skeletons wear breastplates and use
shields, giving them AC 18. They patrol in groups of
three, and they are trained in hoplite soldier tactics.
Minotaur Skeletons. The minotaur skeletons patrol
in pairs, with one minotaur attacking the heroes from
the front while the other comes from the rear.
The skeletons in Xander's tomb are equipped differently
than standard skeletons. All of them have breastplates,
shields, short swords, and pikes. The skeletons fight in
a phalanx formation, with the skeleton in front using its
shield, and the skeletons in the back using two handed
pikes. The skeletons in front using shields and short
swords have an AC of 18. The skeletons in the back
have AC 16 and attack using extra-long pikes. They
attack with +4 to hit, reach 15 ft. and inflict 1d10+2
damage on hit.

You may choose to allow the party to try and navigate
the labyrinth as if they were solving an actual maze, but
this may take quite a bit of time. For a simpler approach,
you might consider having the party stumble through
the catacombs, discovering each area in the order that it
has been presented (X19, X20, X21, etc.)
For every 5 minutes of exploration, roll on the following table. As an alternative, you can roll on the table
when the heroes enter a new area in the maze.

The bones in the center of the room suddenly begin

The three minotaur skeletons are the only enemies in
the room. They attack immediately, but will not leave
the maze. Each carries a weathered bronze great axe.

X20. The False Tomb




This circular chamber has a domed ceiling with
an oculus that lets in some light from above. The
chamber is dominated by a large stone sarcophagus
engraved with gilded letters. The floor at the foot of
the sarcophagus is covered by an old but beautifully-woven rug. The rug depicts Xander conquering a
race of bull-headed minotaurs. One of the creatures
kneels at Xander's feet with a peace offering held
above his head.

This room is a false tomb, and a trap for those who
would loot Xander's treasures. The sarcophagus is
a mimic and the rug is an animated rug. The first
person to touch the sarcophagus will become stuck to
it because of the mimic's adhesive ability. The rug and
mimic will then attack with surprise.
There is nothing of value here. The lever at the back
resets the trap in The Trap (X23). Whenever it is pulled,
there is a screeching sound of metal against metal.

X21. Graxis's Lair




This room stinks of blood and offal. Animal carcasses
and slabs of meat hang from the ceiling on heavy
chains. Two of the hanging bodies appear to be those
of human farmers. The stone floor is stained black
by centuries of the minotaur's bloody appetites. This
appears to be his lair.




This room is Graxis' lair. He goes hunting once a month
and stores his kills in here. His curse prevents him from
sleeping, so there is no place for him to rest. It is possible for heroes to set up an ambush here for Graxis.
Treasure
Graxis keeps baubles and coins that he has taken from
those he has hunted and killed. In a bag he has 600 cp,
254 sp, 115 gp, and six pieces of jewelry worth 25 gp each.

X22. The Chamber of Supplicants

This barrel-vaulted chamber is littered with bones,
discarded weapons, and rusted shields. Pillars and
alcoves along the walls house marble statues of priests
and supplicants.

This trap triggers when more than 300 pounds of weight
have gathered in the room.
Bronze Doors. The bronze doors are barred from the
other side and require a DC 30 Strength check to open.
If the trap is triggered the doors will become unbarred,
but will still be stuck and will still require a Strength
check to open as discussed below.
Smash Trap. The trap works over 4 rounds. Have all
players roll initiative. On initiative 20 of the first round,
a portcullis descends in the entrance, cutting off any
retreat. The south wall then begins to push forward with
a screech of metal against metal (characters who pulled
the lever in The False Tomb (X20) will recognize this
noise as being the same one they heard).
On initiative count 10 of the second round, spikes
protrude from the mouths of the wall carvings, dealing
10 (3d6) piercing damage to everyone in the room (one
time only). At initiative count 1 of the fourth round,
anyone who is still alive in the room takes 32 (10d6)
bludgeoning damage as the wall smashes inward.
Anyone reduced to 0 hit points is crushed to a paste.
There are three ways to escape the trap:

• Pulling the lever in The False Tomb (X20) will stop it.

This causes the spikes and portcullis to return to their
original positions, and the trap will remain inactive for
a full hour.
• It is also possible to force open the bronze doors. A
successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check opens the
door in 3 rounds. A check of 20+ opens the door in 2
rounds, while a check of 25+ opens them immediately.
• Lifting the portcullis requires a successful DC 25
Strength (Athletics) check.
Treasure
Scattered amongst the skeletal remains of the victims of
the trap are 112 gp and 245 sp.

X24. Tomb of Xander

The six skeletons in this room form up with three in
front (to block anyone from getting past) and three
behind. The front three skeletons use breastplates,
shields, and shortswords, while those in the rear ranks
are armed with pikes.



This large, barrel-vaulted chamber is decorated with
polished bronze fittings, which flicker like gold in the
dim red light of a single torch. The center of the room
is dominated by a black marble sarcophagus, engraved
with the likeness of Dragonlord Xander. Whispers break
the silence, solemn voices from ages past, extolling the
deeds of the man interred here...

X23. The Trap




This rectangular room has a high ceiling, sculpted
walls, and a flagstone floor. A mangled skeleton lies
near the entryway. The walls are embellished with
rows of screaming stone faces. The far end of the
room features a pair of heavy bronze double doors.
Two skeletons are sprawled on the floor in front of
the doors. Their bones are partially crushed, and their
armor is mangled.

The chamber is lit by a single everburning torch. The lid
of the sarcophagus weighs nearly a ton. It takes a combined Strength of 22 to slide the lid off the sarcophagus.
As soon as the sarcophagus is opened, if Graxis is alive, he
will arrive to attack the heroes.




The hulking form of Graxis suddenly looms in the
tomb entryway. He snorts derisively. "Come to pay
your respects, have you? Well, what do you think of
your great hero? Xander the conqueror. Xander the
murderer. I am the last of my tribe. I cannot rest. I
cannot sleep. Xander slaughtered my people. He
enslaved my family and bound us to this cursed place.
Among your kind, he is revered for this. But I spit on
his bones."


Without his weapon, Graxis can only use his Gore attack
for the remainder of the battle.
Xander is a wight with a Strength of 22 and maximum
hit points (66). He wears the Breastplate of Mytros (AC
18), though the armor is badly dented. Xander's alignment is true neutral, and he will not fight unless absolutely forced to by the party.
When Graxis is dead, Xander will stand up, silently
remove his breastplate, and lay it on the ground in front
of his sarcophagus. This done, he will silently return to
his sarcophagus and drags the lid back into place.
Treasure
Other than Xander's famed equipment, there is no other
treasure in the room. The Shield of Volkan can be looted
from Graxis's corpse.



Epic Path: The Vanished One

Graxis soon loses patience:




The hulking minotaur hefts his great axe and bellows
so loudly that the very walls of the tomb seem to
quake. He charges at you!


Xander has information concerning the location of the
Vanished One's fabled armor. He will speak to this hero.
He also carries two crowns of the dragonlords, which he
awards to the Vanished One and the Gifted One. Refer to
the Running the Epic Paths section for details.



After two rounds of combat with Graxis, read the following at the start of the third round.




Without a sound, Xander's desiccated corpse rises from
his sarcophagus. He raises his hands towards Graxis.
The minotaur's great axe appears to jump from the
beast's hands of its own volition, flying into the grasp
of the undead king. Xander turns to face your party.
Then, curiously, he changes his withered grip on the
weapon and presents its handle to you.


The Armaments of the Dragonlord
Xander's three legendary items radiate magic and can be
attuned. The items are:

• Axe of Xander
• Breastplate of Mytros
• Shield of Volkan



However, the axe and the shield are badly damaged, and
their magical properties aren't working. These items
must be taken to the Mithral Forge (F21) for repair.
Volkan must use Pythor's Hammer to repair them. He
can repair one item per week of work.

Xander was never one to shy away from battle, but he possessed a
certain nobility of spirit that the other Dragonlords lacked. My mother
believed that he would carry on fighting even in her absence, but after
she ascended, he seemed to no longer care whether he survived to see
the peace restored.

The King's Dragonlords

-King Acastus, to Queen Vallus,
the Goddess of Wisdom

ing Acastus has learned that the
Heroes of the Prophecy have completed the
first of their Great Labors. He has dispatched
seven of his most loyal centurions to find the
heroes and bring them before his throne, and the people
of the great city of Mytros eagerly await the arrival of the
famed heroes. Tales of their great exploits already circulate in every tavern: it is even rumored that they travel in
the company of the gods!
When Should I Start This Chapter?
This chapter introduces major characters and includes
critical story developments. Run this part of the adventure after the heroes have completed two or three of
their Great Labors. The king's centurions might intercept the heroes on the roads of the Heartlands or in the
city of Estoria.

Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King



In the distant skies, you can make out three winged
forms approaching you. The sun shimmers off their
scales, and you realize that they are young copper
dragons. You have heard rumors of the dragons of
Mytros, but these creatures are far more splendid than
you imagined. The dragons are ridden by red-cloaked
knights: high ranking centurions from the city. The dragons descend and touch down several dozen yards away.
Three knights with shields and swords dismount
and approach you. The determined look in their eyes
suggests that they have been sent here with a mission,
but they clearly mean you no harm. Their leader steps
forward and introduces himself, "I am Tarchon. We
have come on behalf of King Acastus to escort you to
his palace. He wishes an audience with you."




Tarchon (NG captain) is accompanied by two other
captains. They are mounted on young copper dragons.
He explains that the Lord of Storms has waylaid the city
of Mytros with a devastating hurricane. King Acastus
expects the heroes to come to the city's aid at once.

Tarchon and his men have been ordered not to return
without the heroes. However, they won't attack the
party, even if provoked. If the heroes refuse to come
with him, Tarchon will appeal to the party's sense of
honor and duty. He also confesses that Acastus is not a
forgiving king; if the knights return empty-handed, he
will be punished.
Tarchon is one of a burgeoning order of dragon-mounted soldiers commanded by the king. They
call themselves Dragonlords, after the king's ancestors.
Kyrah and the other gods are dismissive of this new
order, calling it an exercise in pure vanity.

bolt at the hero with the second lowest initiative. After
the lightning strikes, the storm continues, but Sydon's
face can no longer be seen in the clouds.

TRAVELING TO MYTROS

At this point, you may choose to allow the heroes
to explore the City of Mytros, but the storms make
it difficult to do much of anything beyond visit local
landmarks. Most people are locked down inside to wait
out the storm, and the Great Games cannot begin until
the storms end. Tarchon and his centurions will urge the
heroes to come to the Great Palace as soon as possible.

The Great Palace
Now that the heroes are in the city, Tarchon escorts
them straight to the Great Palace, preventing them from
stopping along the way. He explains that once the king's
dilemma has been resolved, the party will be free to
wander and explore the palace and city.
The Ceaseless Storms

Traveling to Mytros takes about one day from most of
the outer reaches of the Heartlands. You may choose to
run one random land encounter during this time. If
Tarchon and his men are present, they will leave all the
dangerous work to the heroes. They have no wish to risk
harm to their dragons.

The Royal Gate

THE THRONE ROOM

This massive gate can be accessed from the paved road
that snakes up the hillside. The road is wide enough to
accommodate traffic moving in both directions. The
towers that flank the gate are carved to represent the
writhing forms of dozens of dragons.




As you approach the city of Mytros, you are reminded
of its immense scale. Its walls and temples sprawl
across the foundations of Mount Volkan, and its great
harbor stretches for miles across the coast. This is the
jewel of Thylea: the bastion of mortal civilization.
But something is wrong. Massive, swirling black
clouds loom over the city, the wind battering its ships
and tearing at its banners. Howling gales greet you
as your draw closer to the city gates, and it becomes
difficult just to put one foot in front of another. The
centurions at the Royal Gate urgently beckon you into
the city as torrential rain hammers down.
Glancing up into the sky, you notice that something
ominous has materialized within the spinning eye
of the hurricane. It's the scowling visage of Sydon,
Lord of Storms. His angry eyes rove the city, until
they abruptly lock onto your exact position. The titan
conjures a crackling white bolt of lightning and hurls
it at you.


Have the heroes roll for initiative. Whoever rolls the
lowest is immediately struck by the bolt of lightning,
which hits with the same effects as a lightning bolt spell.
The chosen hero still gets a saving throw versus the
spell. You may choose to have Sydon throw a second

King Acastus (see appendix) can be found here during
the day. The king is always protected by seven of his best
centurions (LG captains). He is usually accompanied
by his concubine Bella (CN noble). He frequently calls
upon the services of Commander Gaius (see appendix),
who represents the Order of Sydon within the city.




Centurions escort you through marble colonnades of
the palace and into the Royal Hall, where the king waits.
Rain hammers loudly upon the palace roof and, as you
enter the throne room, an ear-splitting crack of thunder
rolls across the sky.
A middle-aged man with a powerful build sits on
a gilded throne opposite the entrance. On the step
below him are four others: a beautiful ageless woman
of regal bearing, a soldier dressed in a cerulean cloak,
a tiefling wearing a black robe, and a finely-dressed
young woman. Centurions stand at attention along the
walls of the room.




Acastus is certainly cunning, but it will avail us little against


the power of the Titans. This is not an age that demands
crafty politicians or charismatic kings. We need heroes and
great warriors: no more, no less.

The King's Dilemma




The king beams on seeing you. "Here they are-the
Heroes of the Heartlands. Welcome, honored guests!
You have come not a moment too soon. I am in desperate need of your counsel. As you may have noticed,
our beautiful city is besieged by evil weather. We have
wasted several days discussing how best to placate the
Lord of Storms, but my advisors cannot seem to agree
upon anything.
"The Oracle's prophecy has angered Sydon. That
much is clear. You are the ones who were foretold to
confront the Titans and restore balance to Thylea.
Therefore, I have decided that you must be the ones to
decide how we resolve this crisis."


The Origin of the Dragon Eggs
If Acastus is ever asked about where he found the
dragon eggs that have allowed him to revive the
Dragonlords, he will lie. He says that he sent heroes
to explore Thylea a decade ago in an attempt to find
dragon eggs. His plan has finally come to fruition, for his
heroes discovered a cache of dragon eggs and the lair of
an adult silver named Icarus. Acastus claims that Icarus
has befriended him, and the dragon wishes to help him
rebuild the order.

Four Possible Solutions



King Acastus and Queen Vallus (see appendix) are
accompanied by Gaius and Bella. The tiefling calls
himself Chondrus (see appendix). He is an emissary
from the Cult of Lutheria and the king dislikes him.
He cannot be ignored, however, because he represents
powerful interests within the city.
King Acastus is charming but arrogant. He will
introduce the other characters (including his wife, the
queen) in the throne room with polite condescension.
Each character present has a different opinion on how to
handle the crisis, and each states their preferred course
of action. The heroes are then expected to decide what
should be done.

Secretly, Acastus knows that every possible course of
action will be considered controversial by the people
of Mytros, and he does not want to be held responsible
for any consequences. He wants the heroes to make the
decision, so that they will be blamed rather than him.
In summary, here are the options that the heroes must
choose from:

• Cast the 8th level spell control weather.
• Order the destruction of the Temple of the Five.
• Purchase 10,000 gp worth of livestock to sacrifice.
• Convince the gods to work a miracle.
Whichever solution the heroes choose, the king
will order it done immediately. If the chosen action is
successful, Sydon will be appeased or his magic will be
countered. In either case, the storms will pass.
Option 1: King Acastus
First, the king wonders whether the heroes can stop
the storm with magic. He has heard that there are
powerful spells that may be used to alter the weather.
Surely if the rumors about the heroes are true, then
they should be mighty enough to command such
magic?
Controlling the Weather

King Acastus

Acastus refers to the 8th level spell control weather,
which the heroes probably cannot cast. However, if the
party has collected two sets of nymph-hair strings, then
they can craft the Boreal harp at the Mithral Forge. In
this case, a bard will be capable of casting the spell, but
Acastus is impatient, so the harp must have been created
before they answer the summons to Mytros.

When it becomes clear that the heroes cannot use
magic, the king feigns disappointment. If the heroes
chose not to sacrifice the great boar to Sydon earlier
in the story, Acastus may also wonder aloud at their
wisdom in making such a decision.
Option 2: Commander Gaius
Gaius angrily demands that the king dismantle the
Temple of the Five and smash every stone to dust.
Sydon abhors the worship of other gods, and especially
worship of the Five. Gaius has argued for decades that
the Temple of the Five should be destroyed, but the idea
has recently gained some popular support. If Gaius is
to be believed, smashing the temple is the only way to
appease the Lord of Storms.
Gaius is also contemptuous of both the heroes and
Queen Vallus. She is, after all, one of the Five Gods
and the daughter of the patron god of the city. As the
commander of the Order of Sydon, Gaius believes that
the city must abandon its worship of the Five, and stop
putting any faith in these "puppets of the Oracle."
Destroying the Temple
If the heroes choose to order the destruction of the
Temple of the Five, then the gods will grudgingly accept
this course of action. Vallus and Kyrah have long believed
that it was inevitable that their power would wane and
that the people of Mytros would lose faith, but they
had hoped that it would not happen in such a fashion.
However, this loss of worship still causes pain to the Five.
As a result of the temple's destruction, Kyrah, Vallus,
Pythor, and Volkan will become dispirited and suffer one
level of permanent exhaustion.

Option 3: Chondrus
Chondrus argues that Sydon can only be placated by the
intervention of Lutheria, his sister-wife. To gain her help
the king should order seventy children of the city to
"take the black robes" and dedicate themselves to the
Cult of Lutheria. He promises that the Lady of Dreams
will treat the children well-they will eat the finest of
foods and drink the sweetest of wines.
In fact, they will all be sacrificed in the cult's perverse
blood rituals. Everyone suspects this and hates the
suggestion. Queen Vallus would have Chondrus killed
before she would allow it to happen.
Keeper of the Great Library
Chondrus appears later in the adventure on the Island
of Yonder. He hopes to convince the heroes to bargain
with Lutheria. If the heroes manage to turn the king
against him, he will use dimension door to escape back
to his lair.

Option 4: Bella the Concubine
In normal circumstances, Bella should have no voice
in this matter, but the king indulges her. She innocently asks why the usual solution has not been tried.
Normally, the priests of Sydon sacrifice dozens of
animals to placate the storm god. Acastus explains that
for a storm like this one, they would need to perform a
hecatomb, a sacrifice of 100 oxen. This would require
half the livestock in the city, and it would cost about
10,000 gp. Perhaps the heroes might pay the cost? The
royal coffers cannot afford such an expense...
Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

89

Vallus wants the heroes to convince Pythor, Kyrah,
and Volkan to help her work a miracle. This depends
on the heroes' ability to convince the other three gods
to surrender a portion of their power to protect the city
from Sydon's magic. Working the miracle will cause the
gods to suffer one level of permanent exhaustion, but
it will bolster the city's faith in the Five Gods.

Queen Vallus

Performing a Miracle
If the heroes choose this course of action, then Vallus
calls Kyrah, Pythor, and Volkan into the throne room.
The heroes must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma
(Persuasion) check. Alternatively, you can simply roleplay this encounter by having each hero make a separate
plea to the gods.
If the gods are convinced, then they will vow to
protect the city. They thank the heroes for their wisdom
and go to the Temple of the Five to seek the guidance
of Mytros.

THE STORMS VANISH


For centuries, I ruled this city alone. With the looming war,
I sought to share my burden with Acastus. Even the gods
may have regrets.

- Vallus, Goddess of Wisdom

Option 5: Queen Vallus




Queen Vallus suddenly stands up from her throne and
approaches you directly, ignoring the protests of the
king. She radiates a sense of profound intellect and
divine beauty.
"Heroes of the Prophecy, I greet you. I am Vallus, of
the Five Gods. For centuries, the people of Mytros have
revered me as the goddess of wisdom. Mortal kings
once traveled from across the Cerulean Gulf seeking
my counsel but, as you can see, my husband prefers to
consult with fools and concubines.
"We gods are capable of saving the city. Joined
together, the four of us can weave a spell to counter
Sydon's magic. Such a miracle will require a sacrifice of
our power. I will do what must be done to protect my
city, but the others will need to be persuaded.
"I have summoned Kyrah, Pythor, and Volkan to the
palace so that you might speak with them and make
them see reason. You are the Oracle's chosen. They will
heed your words."


Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King



Hours pass, and the storm gradually relents. Light breaks
through the breaking clouds, spilling down onto the
marble pediments and wet paving stones of the city.
Slowly, citizens begin to emerge from their homes. Before
long, the usual bustle of everyday life in Mytros resumes.
King Acastus looks pleased. "Excellent work! I knew
I could trust you to handle this matter. Now, let's see
about your reward..." He pulls a rolled parchment out
of his cloak and hands it to you.
"This map will lead you to the last known whereabouts of the Ultros. It was my ancestor's ship, the
legendary vessel of Estor Arkelander, fiercest of the
Dragonlords. There was a time when I thought I might
claim it for myself, but I have no need of it now."
"You should know that I am rebuilding the ancient
order of the Dragonlords. In time, I will have a legion of
dragon-mounted warriors under my command. Then
we will have no more need of heroes and Oracles. We
shall drive back the Titans with the power of the dragons, just as my forefathers did."
"In any case, this map will allow you to resume your
so-called 'Great Labors.' I thank you for the service you
have done my city. You are dismissed."




The king rewards the heroes with the map to the Ultros,
which was last seen near the Dead Falls.
Acastus encourages the heroes to leave his city as
soon as possible, because their fame has begun to overshadow his own. Secretly, he will pray to Sydon that his



bloodthirsty undead ancestor will kill the heroes and put
an end to their glory-hogging ways.
If the heroes ask why they must recover the Ultros
instead of sailing some other ship, Acastus explains,
truthfully, that the wrath of Sydon makes travel beyond
the coast nearly impossible. They will need a legendary
ship if they are to survive the journey.
The King's Motives
As a descendant of the Dragonlords, Acastus feels as
though he will never live up to the legends of his ancestors. The ghost of Estor Arkelander taunts the king in
his dreams, promising him fame, glory, and immortality.
However, the king knows that his ancestor has treacherous designs. Estor seeks to possess a living host so that
he may wreak vengeance upon the Titans. Acastus is
sending the heroes to the Ultros, hoping to kill two birds
with one stone.

SUMMONED
BY THE QUEEN

Before the heroes leave the Great Palace, Queen Vallus
sends her chief stewardess, Makhaira, to intercept them
as they are leaving the throne room. Makhaira escorts
the heroes to see the queen in her chambers.

The Queen's Chambers
When the heroes arrive, Queen Vallus is resting on
a divan across from a series of gilded mirrors. She is
accompanied by many scribes and servants in white.
While Acastus is off playing king, Vallus works hard
behind closed doors, performing the many necessary
duties of a true head of state.
The Queen's Warriors
The queen's chief stewardess is Makhaila (LG amazon
warrior), who commands twelve amazon warriors.
Makhaira was exiled from Themis by Queen Thesilea VI
and came to Mytros ten years ago. She is fiercely loyal to
Queen Vallus.

The Queen's Warning
Vallus explains that her husband has not been entirely
honest with the party. The map to the Ultros is accurate,
but the king is almost certainly sending the heroes to
their doom. She knows that Acastus has been troubled
in his sleep by dreams of some kind, and she thinks that
his unusual generosity is somehow connected to this.
He would never give the heroes such a gift unless he
believed that it would work to his advantage.
Vallus insists that when the heroes have acquired
the Ultros, they should return to her immediately. She

is certain that her 'stupid husband' will try to take the
ship. She feels that nothing good can come of Acastus
controlling both the ship and the dragons.
Conflicts in the City
Vallus also explains that there are deep conflicts within
the city between the followers of the Five and the followers of the Titans. She has some suspicions about what
the Titans want. You can decide if your players need to
hear anything of the history of the Titans at this point,
or whether this would only muddy the waters for them.
She is desperately worried that, at the time when the
Oath of Peace ends, the powers of the Five Gods will be
fully spent. If Pythor or Kyrah are present, she will also
be concerned for them, and will make a point of asking
after the health of Volkan, her father.
Quest: The Cult of Lutheria
This quest is optional, depending upon whether or not
you want the party to explore Mytros before they set out
on their quest to recover the Ultros.
Vallus asks the heroes for a favor. Sydon may have
been pacified this time, but the Titans should pay a price
for their cruelty and impudence. While attacking the
Temple of Sydon would be too much of a provocation,
the Cult of Lutheria is gaining a dangerous amount of
influence in the city. Vallus asks the heroes to help the
city by striking a blow against the cult.
The queen suggests that the heroes should investigate the Temple of Lutheria (M20) in Stygian Row. This
is not an invitation to cause chaos in the lower city-
the heroes should approach this carefully and collect
evidence against them if possible. The Cult is popular
because it supplies the city with much of its wine.
One Final Warning
Before the heroes leave, Vallus repeats her warning
about Acastus: the king does not need to know when the
party has recovered the Ultros.
The Blessing of Vallus
If the heroes sacrificed the great boar to Vallus, she will
reluctantly thank them but she doesn't understands why
they did so. Most such offerings are made to her mother,
Mytros. She is appreciative, however, and she grants the
heroes her blessing before they leave.

Encounter: The King's Dragon
The king's dragon, Icarus (CN adult silver dragon),
is loudly snoring in the main courtyard of the Great
Palace, lying atop a small fortune's worth of silver coins.
The king happily allows him to sleep here. The dragon
is attended by seven servants, who have been ordered to
pamper him with new trinkets and freshly-slaughtered
sheep each day.

more than the few coins he allows them, he will grow
annoyed and call for guards to escort them away.

EXPLORING THE CITY

Now that the heroes have solved the king's dilemma and
learned of the whereabouts of the Ultros, they are free to
explore Mytros. They can attempt to recover the Ultros,
participate in the Great Games, or investigate other
strange events in the city.
As the heroes exit the palace, they begin to realize that
their fame precedes them.

Encounter: Your Adoring Fans


Icarus the Adolescent
Although Icarus has the body of an adult dragon, he has
the callow mind of a twenty year-old wyrmling. Gaius's
silver dragon, Argyn, is the same. Twenty years ago, when
Acastus became King of Mytros, Lutheria gave him several dragon eggs, along with potions of aging to feed the
dragons in order to accelerate their growth. Both Icarus
and Argyn were hatched and raised in this way.

The heroes may talk to the dragon if they wish, but it
will quickly become evident that he's spoiled rotten and
completely self-absorbed. Icarus knows little of what is
happening in Thylea, and he cares even less.
Treasure
The dragon's treasure pile contains 20,000 sp. He will
awaken immediately if even a single coin is touched,
but his first instinct is not to be angry. He likes it when
people admire his treasure, and he will allow each hero
to take as much as 25 sp, because he likes to feel generous and lordly. However, if the heroes attempt to take



As you leave the palace, you realize that people everywhere are watching you with great interest. You hear
excited chatter among the crowds. "It's the Oracle's
chosen ones, the heroes of the Heartlands! They've
come to Mytros to save us from the Titans!"
Several merchants approach you, expressing gratitude for the work you've done to make the roads safer
to travel. Detachments of centurions salute as you
walk past. As news of your presence spreads, more and
more admirers crowd around you, vying for your attention. Before long, your progress through the city streets
has slowed to a crawl.


Continuing the Story
Now that the heroes have a map to the Ultros, they may
choose to attempt the next Great Labor. In this case, run
The Ghost Ship Ultros adventure.
Or the heroes may choose to investigate strange
happenings in the city, in which case, they should ask
around for rumors about the Cult of the Snake. This will
lead to the adventures in The Colossus of Pythor section.
With the storms gone, you might decide that it's time
for a celebration in the city. Refer to The Great Games
section to give the party a break from dungeon crawling.

The City of Mytros
Founded five centuries ago, Mytros is named after the
matriarch of the Five Gods-the Goddess of Dawn,
who is also called the 'Silver Queen.' She is the patron
goddess of the city, although her influence has waned
somewhat in recent centuries.
The city was built around a natural harbor, where
trade ships arrive with goods from the distant city of
Aresia. Two great bronze colossi once guarded the
harbor, but only one of them is still standing. The city's
silhouette is dominated by several massive temples.
92

Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King



The hills above the harbor provide views that reach
as far as the Mithral Mountains and the Oldwoods.
These two hills are where the most important buildings
are located. One hill is the religious and political center
of the city, while the other hill is its mercantile center.
Between the hills are slums known as Stygian Row.
Behind the city is Mount Volkan, an extinct volcano
named after the husband of Mytros.
Mytros is mostly a beautiful and clean city. The
streets are cleaned every night, and the citizens frown

upon those who allow their mounts to defecate in the
streets. The city houses close to 50,000 people and,
although the majority of the population are human,
Mytros is the most diverse city in Thylea, with every
race represented.
Many of the greatest structures in the city are built
entirely from marble, inlaid with bronze, adorned with
painted tiles and beautiful mosaics. During the day, the
heat of the sun can make the city seem like a mirage,
as the air shimmers and the buildings glitter from the
reflected sunlight. Great walls surround and protect the
city, with only two major entry points-the Royal Gate
and the Commerce Gate.

FACTIONS IN MYTROS

Mytros is not a united city. A number of factions compete for influence over the citizenry.

The Cult of Lutheria
The Cult of Lutheria is the oldest cult in Mytros. The
cultists are unabashed worshippers of the Lady of
Dreams. Most people find their beliefs and rituals to be
repugnant, but they are tolerated because they provide
wine and entertainment for the popular wine festivals.
In truth, they would have been ejected from the city
a long time ago, except that they have "friends in high
places"-devotees among the aristocracy.

EVENTS IN MYTROS

These are events that can occur in Mytros while the
heroes are exploring the city.

Event: The Great Games


Queen Vallus
Vallus has been the queen of Mytros for centuries, but
she is far removed from her people. As the goddess
of wisdom, she is viewed as the natural successor to
Mytros, her mother, and her right to rule is affirmed by
the Temple of the Five. However, as the Oath of Peace
fails, faith in the Five Gods has waned, and people are
growing restless with anxiety about the Titans.

King Acastus
Acastus has been the king of Mytros ever since he
persuaded Vallus to marry him, some twenty years ago.
He is extremely popular in the city, especially since
he obtained a huge silver dragon. The blood of Estor
Arkelander flows in his veins, and many view him as the
successor of the ancient Dragonlords. Most believe him
to be a strong and wise ruler, or else why would Vallus
have married him?

The Order of Sydon
The Order of Sydon are devout worshippers of the
Lord of Storms. Although the Titan sent hurricanes to
punish the city for its faith in the Five Gods, a surprising
number of people worship him and support the Order.
Commander Gaius is often seen flying over the city on
his silver dragon, and he's a popular figure with young
men and women who dream of joining the Order.

The Cult of the Snake
The Cult of the Snake are known for their abiding
loyalty to a mysterious figure called the Lady of Coins.
Those who displease the Lady are often found turned to
stone, with a green snake painted on a nearby wall. The
Cult of the Snake is actually a thieves' guild, and hence
its influence is covert rather than open. Most of the
thieves in the city are loyal to the Lady.



You hear the sound of a runner's footsteps coming
from behind you. Before you can react, the source of
the noise dashes past you: a lithe young man carrying
a torch. He runs for another block before handing
the flame to another runner, who immediately takes
off in the same direction. The first runner's friends
gather around him and congratulate him. Laughter and
excited shouting fill the air.
"The Great Games are beginning!"




The Great Games begin when the pyre is lit beneath the
ruins of the Colossus of Mytros (M15). Some people in
the street notice the heroes looking at the torch bearer.
They cheerfully explain that anyone, even great heroes,
can enter the Games. If the heroes wish to enter, then
refer to The Great Games section.

Event: The Funeral Sacrifice




You stumble upon a melancholy scene. Dozens of
figures dressed in black robes march somberly down
the street in an orderly procession. Mourners line the
street: wailing spouses, dumbstruck children, and
resigned elders look on. A large bronze cage is held
aloft towards the front of the procession. Inside the
cage is a shackled minotaur.




This is a funeral procession for a dozen centurions killed
fighting the centaur tribes on the borders of civilization.
The women wail in an ostentatious display of grief for
the dead while children look on dumbstruck and slightly
scared by the caged beast.
The caged minotaur is for a ritual battle before the
funeral. Most citizens of Mytros consider minotaurs to
be murderous brutes, fit only for use in games and rituals. They are sometimes captured by slavers and forced
Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

93

into oaths of servitude. Once they've been exhausted by
years of forced labor, they are entered into gladiatorial
games, where most of them are eventually slaughtered.
Refer to the Minotaur Market (M21) for details about
this dark stain on the culture of the city.
The procession stops just outside of the Royal Gate
(M6), where a group of pyres has been lit for the dead
soldiers. Nearby, a walled pen has been constructed for
the funerary games. A group of three soldiers, family
members of the deceased, will be chosen to fight the
minotaur. A priest of Sydon announces that the sacrifice
of the minotaur is a blessing for the dead.
Ritual Combat. The soldiers fight the unarmed
minotaur to the death. As long as the heroes do not
interfere, one of the soldiers will be badly injured but the
minotaur will be defeated and killed. Intervening on the
side of the minotaur will earn the heroes sour looks and
suspicious gossip among the superstitious citizenry.
Optional Event: Bullbug
You can replace the minotaur with Bullbug (NG minotaur hero). Bullbug easily defeats the soldiers, but he
refuses to kill them. Now freed, he calls out a friendly
challenge to the heroes. If one of the heroes can beat
Bullbug, he will offer to join their crew.

Event: Statues of Terror




A small group of people gathers on the road nearby.
The object of their interest is easily spotted. It is an
incredibly lifelike statue of a woman that has suddenly
appeared in the middle of the city street. The statue
has a look of abject terror on its face.


The gathered citizens will agree that the statue is
remarkably lifelike, but none of them recall having seen
it before. Centurions arrive within minutes and ask
everyone to clear away. The centurions explain that this
looks like the work of the Lady of Coins, as though the
heroes should know exactly what that means.
If the heroes express interest, the centurions tell
the heroes to speak with the powerful merchant, Lord
Taran. He has publicly called for the Lady of Coins to be
brought to justice. The centurions are mildly surprised
that he is still alive. Lord Taran can be found at his villa
on the Neurdagon Estate (M11).

forehead. You hear a bleating laugh from the
rooftops. A single goatling grins down at you.
"Keep the change, little starveling!"

RUMORS IN MYTROS

Mytros is the center of trade in Thylea, and so it is a
place where rumors from all corners of the land can be
heard. These rumors might be overheard on the streets,
in marketplaces, or in taverns:
Rumors in the City of Mytros
d12

Rumor

1

The Order of Sydon has demanded that the
statues of the Five in the Great Agora be knocked
down. King Acastus has refused them, for now.

2

The Great Games will be starting soon. Aresia has
sent its best team in years and might embarrass
Mytros. Even stranger, the Amazons of Themis
have sent a delegation to the Games.

3

Gaius, the leader of the Order of Sydon, now has
more influence over King Acastus than the goddess Vallus. How can such a thing come to be?

4

King Pythor, the God of Battle, has abdicated his
throne and no one knows where he has gone!

5

The petrified victims of the Lady of Coins are
being found in increasing numbers. King Acastus
has been unable to stop her! Perhaps the Order of
Sydon will help...

6

The great chimera of the Cerulean Gulf took a
dozen victims aboard a merchant ship that was
just one day's journey from Mytros.

7

Ekoh, an oread, is calling for war with Aresia
again. After 500 years, she's still trying to get her
betrothed back. She should really give it a rest.

8

The most powerful merchant of Mytros, Lord
Stavros, was banished to the Isle of Exiles for
poisoning the son of his rival!

9

The Order of Sydon grows too powerful. They
have seemingly unlimited wealth. Some think
their wealth comes from the lost gygan ruins on
the Island of Yonder.

10

The barbarian tribes of Indigo Island have been
unusually quiet as of late. There have been no
raids in recent years. What are they planning?

11

Something has disturbed Kentimane. The Titan's
great arms are on the move! Many have seen it!

12

The great vortex known as Charybdis has swallowed another ship. The ship was from Aresia.
It was heading to Scorpion Island, full of young
warrior monks going to their final trial.

The news from Mytros is never good. Merchants in the
Heartlands even have a saying: "South winds carry
sirens on wings with ill tidings."
- Kyrah, Goddess of Music

THE TEMPLE DISTRICT

The Temple district is so named because it is home
to both the ancient Temple of the Five and the newer
Temple of Sydon. This is the center of religious and civic
power in Mytros. It's also where the Great Palace can be
found. Everything in this part of the city is impressive:
the Theater of the Gods can hold crowds of thousands,
while the Academy is one of the greatest centers of
learning anywhere in the world.

M1. Temple of Sydon




Before you stands an imposing structure supported
by carved stone columns. A series of steps carved
to resemble crashing waves leads to the temple's
entrance. Inside is an enormous central statue made of
blue-green marble. It depicts a tall, wrathful man with
three eyes and long gray hair. He wields an onyx black
glaive. This is Sydon, the Lord of Storms.




This temple is the primary place of worship for Sydon
in all of Thylea. The temple itself is a peripteros with 48
columns. It is built on a high podium that is accessed by
an imposing set of steps shaped like ocean waves.
A stair at the center of the temple leads to several
underground chambers where the paladins of Sydon
meet to discuss the Order's many plans.
The Order of Sydon are headquartered here. They are
a band of zealots who revere the ocean god Sydon above
all others. They seek to the end all worship of the Five.
During the day, the temple is filled with citizens who
come to hear the teachings of Sydon or receive blessings
from the priests. During these busy periods, at least
three priests of Sydon with six captains as protectors
can be found within. At night, the temple proper is
quiet, although the underground chambers are occupied
by priests and soldiers.
Gaius and His Dragon
The highest-ranking member of the Order of Sydon is
the paladin, Commander Gaius. During the day, he can
often be found in the Great Palace (M4), but at night
he is usually here. Gaius is a true believer-a zealot who
knows that the Five are false gods, thieves who stole the
power of the true god, Sydon.
According to Gaius, the Five are useless pretenders:
Pythor is a carousing drunkard; Kyrah composes terrible
poetry; Vallus preens herself in an ivory tower; and
Volkan is a crazy old dwarf who builds useless trinkets.
Once the heroes sail into the Cerulean Gulf on the
Ultros, Gaius will move to the Island of Yonder, where
the Order of Sydon have a base. Gaius is able to move
between Yonder and Mytros easily due to a gift given to
him by Sydon: Argyn (LE young silver dragon).

Argyn was bred by Sydon at his tower, Praxys (S25).
The dragon has been conditioned to believe that the
Five are evil and that Sydon is the one and only force
for good in the world. Argyn's presence in the city is the
subject of widespread gossip and admiration, but the
dragon's very existence infuriates Queen Vallus.

M2. Temple of the Five




This relatively humble temple has an entrance with
five stone columns. While it is smaller than the
Temple of Sydon, it displays a much higher level of
artistry, boasting lofty architecture and beautiful
statuary. Intricate carvings embellish nearly every surface, complete with gilding and inlaid precious stones
throughout.




This temple is the oldest civic building in Mytros.
Elected representatives from the city districts of Mytros
and the outlying villages meet in council here every new
moon. However, the structure of civic life is increasingly dictated by the Order of Sydon, who believe that
the Temple of the Five should be destroyed in order to
appease the jealousy of the Lord of Storms.
Queen Vallus often visits here. During the day, she can
be found at the palace, where she runs the city's civic
affairs. She comes here at night to pray to her mother,
Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn.
The temple is tended by five high priests (LG priests)
and each high priest is attended by five acolytes. The
priests provide all common temple services at no charge,
including the lesser and greater restoration spells.

Test of Beauty and Wisdom
Outside of the temple during the day is a gang of young
men who are admirers of Vallus. They are led by a vain
young man named Sulla (LN acolyte), the youngest son
of the powerful merchant, Taran Neurdagon.
Sulla is enamored with Vallus, and spends all of his
time trying to gain an audience with the goddess or
catch a glimpse of her as she leaves the temple. Vallus
finds the young man obnoxious. She ignores him
entirely, much to his chagrin. The last time he tried to
gain her attention, Vallus told him that she would agree
to have an audience with him if he brought her a single
mortal of unsurpassed beauty and wisdom.
Sulla has heard of the heroes' exploits. He will single
out the hero with the highest Charisma score and
another with the highest Wisdom score. He begs the
two heroes to accompany him to see Vallus. If the party
agrees, then Sulla will take them directly to the queen.
Vallus is amused by the fact that the heroes have
been roped in by Sulla, but she will humor them.
Sulla presents the two heroes and extolls their beauty
and wisdom, hoping to impress her. Vallus remains
unmoved, pointing out the heroes' various flaws.
This forces Sulla into the realm of hyperbole-the
heroes are the wisest, most beautiful creatures ever to
grace the city! Vallus reluctantly agrees, until finally,
Sulla's unrequited affections have been completely
transferred from the queen to the heroes.
Sulla proposes marriage to each of the heroes, offering a gold ring inset with a diamond worth 1,000 gp.
Whichever hero agrees to marry the young man gets
the ring. The agreement is not binding, but this entire
situation greatly amuses the queen.

memory. There was little else for a young tiefling
to look forward to in Stygian Row.



M3. The Theater of the Gods




A fine theater stands at the foot of the Temple Hill.
Rows of seats built into the hillside are arranged
around a polished marble stage. Behind the stage is a
small building where stagehands and costumed actors
come and go, carrying elaborate props.






The theater has a marble stage that extends in front of
an orchestra pit. It has a four-tiered seating area that
ascends the slope of the hill. The building behind the
stage has rooms for actors to prepare and storage for
props and movable scenery.
The Wine Festival. The theater usually stands empty,
but if the Wine Festival is happening in Mytros, then it
will be busy for a full week. Refer to the Wine Festival
event in the City of Estoria (E1) for details.

M4. The Great Palace




The Great Palace stands at the top of an impressive
stone stairway. It is similar in appearance to the temples of the gods, except that its design emphasizes its
civic function. Rather than statues to the gods, the
palace is decorated with royal seals and with bronze
tablets describing the legal codes of the city.




While not nearly as grand as the city's temples, this
palace is still an impressive building. The stairs lead to
an expansive antechamber, which connects to the throne
room in the Royal Hall. This is where King Acastus can
be found during the day.
The heroes are summoned here when they first arrive
in the city. King Acastus is usually accompanied by his
advisor, Chondrus (see appendix), his concubine Bella
(CN noble), and Gaius, commander of the Order of
Sydon (see appendix). Acastus is always protected by
five of his best centurions (LG captains).
Permission to Enter the Palace
The city guards generally restrict access to the Great
Palace, but the heroes are allowed entry because they
have been summoned by the king. After their audience
with Queen Vallus, the heroes can revisit the palace
whenever they like. Refer to the Summoned by the King
section for details.

Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King



The sprawling campus grounds of the Academy bustle
with activity. Over a dozen impressive marble buildings
stand in rows, connected by paved, well-maintained
pathways. Rich green lawns stretch between the pathways, and scholars can be seen reading, writing, and
hotly debating all manner of subjects.


The Academy is spread throughout more than a dozen
buildings. This is one of the greatest centers of learning
not just in Thylea but most likely in all the world.
The Great Library contains scrolls detailing knowledge on the flora and fauna of Thylea as well as information on topics such as metallurgy, alchemy, medicine,
cartography, and almost any other imaginable subject.
The Hall of Heroes is devoted to recording the heroic
exploits of Thylea's heroes throughout the ages. Marble
statues and busts of all of Thylea's heroes can be found
here as well as scrolls of their histories and songs.
The Schools of the Arcane consist of eight buildings
devoted to the study of the eight schools of magic, each
headed by an arcane master (LN mages).
The Great Orrery is a building that contains a replica
of the many planes of existence, represented as celestial
spheres fashioned from bronze clockwork.
The Hall of Debate provides a forum where any philosophy can be discussed without repercussions, even if
it veers into the theological. Some of the greatest minds
in Thylea can be found debating philosophy here:

• Machaon (CG half-orc mage)
• Chalcodon (LG elf noble)
• Kerodotos (NG gnome priest)
• Atreus (CN tiefling captain)
The Academy is well protected and if anyone is foolish
enough to make trouble here, they will be quickly subdued by the arcane masters.
Event: The Great Debates
The heroes are invited to participate in a series of
philosophical debates at the Hall of Debate. Machaon,
Chalcodon, Kerodotos, and Atreus all wish to test the
intellectual mettle of the so-called "Saviors of Thylea."
Each of the philosophers poses a paradoxical problem
to the heroes and then awaits a response. There are no
right answers to these puzzles: the philosophers want to
see how the heroes behave in the debate. They will be
impressed if the heroes take the exercise seriously. They
will be disappointed if the heroes are sarcastic or silly in
their responses.
Machaon. The famed ship that brought the
Dragonlord Adonis Neurdagon from the old lands to
the lands of Thylea was the Valorous. The Valorous had
sixty oars, a single mast, and a great prow. Over the

centuries, it has decayed, and the Neurdagon family
removed the old oars and planks, replacing it with
newer and stronger timber. They replaced the mast
when it was cracked in a storm, and they replaced the
prow when the ship ran aground. After five centuries,
every single piece of the Valorous has been replaced.
Is the Valorous now the same ship that once carried
Adonis Neurdagon, or is she a different vessel?
Chalcodon. Pythor is in a footrace with a tortoise.
Pythor allows the tortoise a head start of 300 feet. If we
suppose that each racer starts running at some constant
speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some
finite time, Pythor will have run 300 feet, bringing him
to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the
tortoise has run a much shorter distance of only 30 feet.
It will then take Pythor some further time to catch up
to those additional 30 feet, by which time the tortoise
will have moved even farther ahead. It takes more time
for Pythor to reach the third point, while the tortoise
continues to maintain his lead...
Thus, whenever Pythor arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before
he can catch the tortoise, despite running much faster.
Clearly, this means that Pythor will never catch the tortoise. How do you explain this paradox?
Kerodotos. A sphinx captures the young crown prince
of Mytros. His mother comes to the sphinx and pleads
for the return of her son. The sphinx replies that he will
only return the prince safely if the mother can guess
correctly whether or not he will indeed return the boy.
What is the problem here? As it turns out, there is
no problem if the mother guesses that the sphinx will
return him: if she is right, the boy is returned; if she is
wrong, the sphinx keeps him.
However, if she answers that the sphinx will not
return him, we end up with a paradox: if she is right
and the sphinx never intended to return her child, then
the sphinx has to return him, but in doing so, he breaks
his word and contradicts the mother's answer. On the
other hand, if she is wrong and the sphinx actually did
intend to return the boy, then the sphinx must keep
him, even though he did not intend to do so, thereby
also breaking his word.
Atreus. What is the nature of good and evil? Are
they metaphysical properties that can be measured or
changed? For example, if a man commits murder, his
neighbors may call him evil. We may rightly say that he
has evil properties. Hoping to atone for his act, this man
may offer to pay the victim's family gold pieces to compensate for their loss. Now, let us say that the victim's
family is satisfied by the payment, and they forgive him,
saying that he is no longer evil. The man had evil properties before he made the payment, but now he does not.
If properties of objects cannot be created or destroyed
but merely transferred, where did the evil properties go?
Are the coins now evil? Is the family evil?

Reward. For participating in the debate, the four great
philosophers award the heroes signed copies of their
books: Machaon's Paradoxia, Chalcodon's Mathematika,
Dialogues of Kerodotos, and Atreus's Metaphysika. The
books are worth 1 gp each, and each takes 1 day to read.
Studying all four books grants proficiency in Arcana.

This massive gate is wide enough to accommodate
traffic moving in both directions. The towers that flank
the gate are carved to seem as if they are made from
the writhing forms of dozens of dragons

This gate is always guarded by two captains and twenty
soldiers. They are extremely disciplined and refuse to
engage in conversation with passersby.

THE NOBLE DISTRICT

The Noble District is loud, crowded, and colorful.
Merchants from all across Thylea come here to ply
their trades at the Great Agora, and to keep their wealth
in the Royal Bank. Many of the wealthiest citizens of
Mytros have real estate here.

M7. The Great Agora




The Great Agora serves as the heart of both the Noble
District and Mytros itself. A multitude of vendors sell
all kinds of goods from across the continent. Their
stalls are protected from the elements by rows of
narrow, roofed structures, supported by columns.
Sprawled out beyond the Great Agora are a number of
large private estates, bathhouses, and temples.




Huge marble roofed colonnades or stoa provide shelter
from the sun and the weather here. Twelve-foot-tall
statues of the Five watch from the edges of the Agora.
A new statue of Sydon stands at its center, and it towers
higher than any of the statues of the Five.
Merchants from all over Thylea gather here during the
day to trade and to sell their wares. All manner of goods
can be found here; from foodstuffs such as fish, meat,
wine, cheese; to animals such as cows, goats, and sheep;
to pottery, clothes, and bronze equipment.

M8. The Vault of Thylea



This small shop is tucked away in a shady corner of the
marketplace. The inside of the shop is dusty and dark,
and the walls are stocked with bottles of all kinds.




This beautiful bank doubles as a place of worship for
Thylea, the Mother Goddess. The vault is sanctified by
a circle of druids, who tend to a single great oak tree
that grows from the central courtyard.




The bankers are elves who have devoted themselves to
the Mother Goddess (TN druids). For a monthly fee of
1 gp, anyone can entrust their money, jewelry, gems, or
other treasures to the bankers, who will store them in
the network of tunnels beneath the huge oak tree.

This shop is run by Zorin (TN mage), a disgruntled
alchemist who washed out of the Academy (M5). He
sells potions and lesser magic items.
Zorin spent years perfecting his potions, but all his
teachers cared about were oratory skills. Unfortunately
for him, he has a habit of insulting his audience in any
long conversation. He opened his shop when it became
clear that he had no future as a famous philosopher.

This shop is set up in a large tent at one of the stoas.
Inside the tent, it seems darker and colder than it

A hooded man introduces himself to the heroes as the
Collector (LE mage). He travels throughout Thylea and
collects exotic beasts and creatures. He offers to sell any
of these creatures to interested heroes.
Caged Animals. The cages hold a muzzled lion,
a muzzled cheetah, a hooded cockatrice, a hooded
harpy, a muzzled brown bear, a trussed up goatling,
and a trussed up young centaur. The Collector offers to
sell any of these creatures for a paltry sum of 100 gp, but
he stresses that all sales are final.
With the exception of the young centaur, none of the

Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

The laws of Mytros are primarily focused on how to
punish someone who has been convicted of a crime. Jury
trials determine whether a crime has been committed.
Debts. If someone is delinquent in paying a debt, they
have one week to pay it. After that, the debtor may be
brought before the court forcibly. Unless the debtor
pays the amount owed, the debtor is forced to serve the
person he owes for a period of one day for every gold
piece owed until the debt is paid.
Capital Offenses. Murder, bribery of a court official,
and treason are punishable by death by "the Dragon."
This is also the fate of anyone convicted of burning a
building within the city (or on the outlying farms and
settlements).
Theft and assault are all punished by enslavement as an
oarsman aboard a ship chosen by the courts for a period
no less than one year, up to a life sentence. The guilty
party may choose death by "the Dragon" instead.
The Dragon. This is an ancient chimera that is kept
imprisoned in a cavern below the courts. Two of its heads
are muzzled, so it will only use its dragon fire on a victim
tossed down to it for punishment.

M9. The Courts of Mytros




A broad, circular, white marble building stands apart
from the other structures in this district. It's divided
into three floors with rows of symmetrical windows.
Several large bronze tablets at the entrance of the
building describe the laws of the city.




The court building is circular and its interior has ten
rows of seats that circle the entire inside circumference.
At the center is a raised platform where both accused
and the accuser stand. Court cases in Mytros are
decided by jury, and the court can accommodate more
than 300 jury members at once, if required.

M10. The Bathhouse of Vallus




This bathhouse boasts two large baths, both the size of
swimming pools. One is filled with hot water, while the
other is filled with bracingly cold water. The connected
buildings include two huge open air gymnasiums and
dozens of smaller rooms for massages.




There are several bathhouses located in the city of
Mytros, but all of them pale in significance when
compared to this one. Queen Vallus had this bathhouse
constructed two centuries ago, to celebrate victory in
one of the Aresian campaigns. It is a place for exercise,
business agreements, courtships, gossip-and even the
occasional bath. While visiting the bathhouse is ostensibly free, there are several acolytes collecting donations.







This is one of the most expensive villas in Mytros. It is
home to the powerful merchant lord, Taran Neurdagon
(LN noble). He is descended from the ancient
Dragonlord, Adonis Neurdagon, and he has access to
immense wealth, although most of it is bound up in his
sizable real estate holdings.
Taran doesn't allow uninvited guests, but he is willing
to make an exception for heroes who are willing to perform a specific task for him: he wants someone to track
down and destroy the so-called Lady of Coins.
Guardians. The entrance to the estate is guarded by
two veterans. These stalwarts will turn the heroes away



This verdant garden is circled by a ring of immense,
ancient oak trees. The air around you is sweet with the
scents of flowers, although many of them are unrecognizable to you. You can hear loud voices down one of
the many paths that wander into the green spaces.



Before you stands the most opulent villa in the city.
Despite its great size, the house itself is difficult to see:
the grounds are full of lush gardens, statuary, pools,
fields, and a large hedge maze with what appears to be
a great fountain shooting up from its center.


Quest: The Lady of Coins
When Taran eventually appears, he explains his predicament to the heroes. The Lady of Coins is a self-styled
folk hero who robs from the rich and gives to the poor of
Stygian Row. She has an intense hatred for the minotaur slave trade and aggressively attacks those who try
to make an honest profit. Taran admits that he makes a
large portion of his wealth from the minotaur slave trade,
so his business suffers more than most.
Taran explains that the Lady is cursed-she is a
medusa who petrifies anyone who crosses her. Further,
he explains that minotaurs are violent beasts with
limited intelligence who revel in bloodshed, and the fact
that the Lady of Coins has an affinity for them speaks
volumes about her character. Taran also suspects that
she is behind the Cult of the Snake, a thieves' guild
deeply involved with smuggling and murder.
Reward. Taran offers the heroes 5,000 gp for the
Lady's head. He is willing to pay as much as 10,000 gp, if
pressed. He advises the heroes to begin their search for
the Lady in Stygian Row.



unless they mention the Lady of Coins, at which point,
they will invite the heroes into the main courtyard to
await Taran. The estate is also patrolled by two captains
and twelve soldiers from the Order of Sydon.
Treasure. Taran keeps 500 pp and 5,000 gp worth of
gemstones, jewelry, and other trinkets in a locked chest
in the study of his estate. The chest can be opened with
a successful DC 20 Dexterity check with thieves' tools.
The chest also contains the deeds for over 6,000 acres of
land in the regions surrounding Mytros.



The Great Gardens of Mytros are held to be the most
beautiful in all Thylea, boasting many paths, trees,
flowers, ponds, and fountains to heal the restless spirit.
The gardens are surrounded by perfectly-ordered oak
trees, all of which are five centuries old. These oaks were
planted when the city was founded.
Vitalis (LN halfling commoner) resides here. This
corpulent halfling is sometimes called "Vitalis the Fat"
or "Vitalis the Fragrant" (although never to his face).
Many believe him to be the wisest mortal in Mytros.
Vitalis lives, sleeps, and eats in the gardens, and he is
well-fed by his many admirers.
However, his personal habits don't seem particularly
wise, as he never cleans himself, and he dresses in rags.

THE HARBOR

He also flatulates, belches, and harasses everyone who
passes by. Some of his favorite insults include:



• It looks like your face caught fire... and someone tried

to put it out with a hammer!
• You're so ugly that when your mother sent you out to
play, they fined her for littering!
• Mirrors reveal many things, but they cannot talk...
and lucky for you, they can't laugh, either!
• You there! Turn around. Hmmm... I can tell that you're
a centaur, but all I can see is the rear end!
Seeking Advice. Despite his foul demeanor, Vitalis
deserves his reputation. He gives out sound advice to
anyone who pays him in fine food or wine. He devours
the offerings and then answers questions in a drunken
haze, one question per person who feeds him. Treat this
as the equivalent of the divination spell.
On subsequent or follow-up questions, he will shoo
interrogators away, tell them that they must make their
own mistakes if they are to learn anything, and probably
pass wind from one end or the other.

The harbor of Mytros is as grand as the rest of the city.
You see ships sailing in and out of the bay, while others
remain tied up at docks. On one side of the harbor
stands an immense bronze statue of a muscular man.
It's clear that another such colossus once stood opposite this one, but it now lies in ruins.


M14. Colossus of Pythor




This is a sister to the Royal Gate. The road here is twice
as wide as the way to the Royal Gate, because it has to
accommodate mercantile traffic coming and going to
the Harbor. The gate is guarded by two captains who
keep an eye out for riff-raff from Stygian Row.







This bronze colossus is recognizable as a young
version of Pythor, God of Battle and current King of
Estoria. The statue's head is wreathed by a crown of
leaves. Despite its relaxed stance and serene gaze, the
statue seems alert to anything that might threaten
the city.



This gate is decorated with beautiful statuary and
surrounded by lush greenery. The stairway beneath the
gate leads up to a verdant plateau: the Noble District.



The harbor of Mytros is the largest in Thylea. Dozens of
ships that ply the sea lanes of the Cerulean Gulf can be
found anchored in the bay, while others are in dry dock,
undergoing repairs.

M13. The Commerce Gate






This colossus is one of the wonders of Thylea. The twin
colossi were constructed before the First War with the
aid of Volkan, God of the Forge. In times of need, the
statues could be activated to defend Mytros. Refer to the
Colossus of Pythor section for details.

M15. The Ruined Colossus

M17. The Fish Market





Although this bronze colossus lies in ruins, it seems
that it once depicted the city's patron goddess, Mytros.
A large pyre blazes at the statue's feet, and a small
crowd has gathered around it.




This colossus was destroyed two centuries ago, and
the tale is still told with horror by the people of
Mytros. The Kraken, a terrifying creature from the
Forgotten Sea, attacked the city during a powerful
storm. The twin colossi wrestled the creature back
into the ocean, but the Colossus of Mytros was torn
apart in the struggle. She returned to her guard post
and collapsed into ruin.

M16. The Dockyard


This bustling dockyard boasts dozens of galleys,
each of which bristles with banks of oars. Many of
the ships seem to have sustained serious damage
recently. You can hear a chorus of hammering from
the drydocks.


The dockyard is always bustling during the day.
Although many merchants trade and bank in the Royal
District, many come dockside to work and barter. There
are bargains to be had with the many ships that arrive
here from across Thylea. There are also more than a
dozen drydocks where ships are repaired.
Sacrificial Stockyard
There is a stockyard here that sells sacrificial animals for
the ceremonies that are customarily performed before
ships embark on ocean voyages. The heroes may purchase such animals and sacrifice them to gain favor with
the gods, or to avoid confrontations at sea.

The fish market is especially crowded in the afternoon, when the fishing boats start returning from the
Cerulean Gulf. Fish of every sort can be found on sale
here, including unusual catches like sharks, eels, and
octopuses. Quality fishing supplies can also be purchased here, including bait, tackle, and nets.
The Ancient Mariner. One of the merchants here is a
dwarf who has sailed Thylea's oceans for over 500 years.
His name is Samuel (TN veteran), and although he's
lost dozens of comrades to the treachery of the seas, he
still makes sacrifices to the Lord of Storms. Samuel has
lots of useful sailing advice to offer to heroes who are
willing to listen to him. One of his favorite stories to tell
is about a legendary city on the back of a dragonturtle
that wanders the Forgotten Sea.

STYGIAN ROW


Sacrificial Livestock for Sale



This crowded marketplace smells strongly of brine.
Barrels of freshly-caught fish line every stall, many of
which have just been unloaded from nearby ships.










This low-lying district is vastly different from the rest
of the city. Its clogged, stinking streets are filthy and
poorly maintained. Ruffians and vagrants shout threatening words at you as you pass. Signs of drunkeness,
violence, and open debauchery are everywhere.




Stygian Row is a wretched hive of scoundrels and sellswords. This is a den of iniquity, where any vice may be
freely indulged, and Lutheria is openly revered. This
part of the city never sleeps, as drunken revelers parade
through the streets at all hours of the night, and merchants hawk their illicit goods in broad daylight.
Tiefling Enclave. The district gets its name from the
word that many Thyleans use for tieflings-"Stygians."
Five hundred years ago, this district was established
as an enclave where tieflings could be corralled,
because they were thought to be untrustworthy spies
of Lutheria.
Half-Orc Enclave. Half-orcs in Thylea are not mistrusted the way they often are in other lands. When the
original settlers learned that no orcs lived in Thylea,
many of the half-orcs among them realized that they
needed to live in close proximity to keep their bloodline
alive. They decided to settle alongside the tieflings.
Both half-orcs and tieflings are common in this
district, though neither race is particularly villainous,
especially when compared to the loathsome humans
who manage the Minotaur Market (M21).

Scantily-clad men and women line this building's large
windows, reclining on crushed velvet pillows, rich silks,
and gilded furniture. The sign hanging above the door
depicts a feathered woman in the throes of ecstasy.
As you enter, a beautiful siren dressed in a scarlet
toga approaches you. "Welcome to the Siren's Roost.
Here, you can taste the finest fruits of immortality.
How may we serve you?"

Quest: Kidnapped Children
Kalistor spends his time in Mytros trying to undermine
the Temple of Lutheria (M20). He believes that Trellus
and Septia are keeping children locked in their wine
cellar for use in human sacrifices. He has no rewards to
offer, but he emphasizes that if the rumors are true, then
rescuing the children would be the right thing to do.
Companions at the Siren's Roost



The woman is Ambrosia (NG siren noble), the owner
of this tavern. She genuinely seeks to entertain her
guests with fine music, wine, and "interesting" company.
Unlike similar establishments, she does not discriminate against satyrs, minotaurs, or centaurs, but she does
prefer to entertain rich clients and famous heroes.
When engaged in longer conversations, Ambrosia
makes it clear that she despises Julius, the owner of The
Satyr's Tail, who used to send thugs to collect "protection" money. Now, she employs Vorena (LN half-orc
captain), a taciturn former centurion, to protect her
establishment. Vorena does her job well.
Each of Ambrosia's escorts claims to trace their lineage to a god or a nymph, so that clients can pick their
preferred flavor of "immortality."
Son of Pythor. One of the escorts is Kalistor (CG
spy), who is actually a child of Pythor. He has met his
104

father only once, and they didn't get along. He is quick
to fall in love with any hero who has 18+ Strength.



The interior of this crowded tavern is thick with smoke
and various unpleasant smells. Many of the patrons
appear to be half-orcs, while others are obviously
sailors. It's difficult to walk through the tavern without
tripping over its many inebriated patrons.

help them track down some missing wine caravans.

M20. Temple of Lutheria




The sailors who come to this tavern drink to forget what
they've seen on the waters of the Cerulean Gulf. The
wine here may be over-sweet and watered-down, but it's
also cheap and plentiful.
The taproom is filled with smoke and smells of fish
and unwashed bodies. The tavern is run by Julius (CE
veteran), a nasty old man and former slave trader. He
had his own galley before he ran afoul of Cerulean
pirates and lost everything, including his left arm. He
doesn't like seeing his patrons bothered. If the heroes
disturb his regulars, he'll send three of his bouncers (CE
thugs) to remove them from the premises.
Fryxon, a satyr, befriended Julius a few years back.
He provides music for the tavern. If a fight breaks out or
the bouncers need help in removing someone, Fryxon
will use his pan pipes to help put aggressors to sleep.
The Cult of the Snake. This is one of the only places
to find information about the Cult of the Snake. Fryxon
loves to cause mischief, and if asked about the Cult of
the Snake, he will loudly introduce the questioners to
Grecos and Nero (see below).
Tavern Patrons
The tavern is crowded day and night by sailors, bandits,
thieves, mercenaries, and other miscreants.
Varkon's Crew. One of the captains is Varkon (CN
bandit captain), a half-orc, who is accompanied by a
half-dozen of his sailors (CN bandits). They are a rowdy
bunch, boasting about their adventures in the Cerulean
Gulf. Varkon often works for the Lady of Coins, and he
isn't afraid to drop her name as a threat. He knows the
route that leads to the Island of the Dragon, and the Lady of
Coins uses him to deliver petrified musicians and performers to Hexia. Varkon also knows where to find the Cult of
the Snake's secret entrance into the Colossus of Pythor.
Grecos and Nero. Another table is occupied by two
thieves who are members of the Cult of the Snake. They
always visit The Satyr's Tail after successful robberies in
order to celebrate by spending their ill-got gains. Grecos
and Nero (CE spies) are brothers who love to insult
the other patrons with sarcastic remarks. They are also
fiercely loyal to the Lady of Coins and, if they notice the
heroes investigating the Lady, they will split up. Grecos
will let the Lady of Coins know that the heroes are interested; Nero will try to follow the heroes.
Wine Merchants. Trellus and Septia (apparently
NE commoners when they appear in public) from the

This small temple stands out from its surroundings due
to the obvious wealth that has been lavished on it.
The temple interior is dominated by dozens of
statues of a grinning, dark-eyed woman with a scythe.
Casks and painted jugs of wine are stacked along the
walls. The temple is filled with a sweet fragrance.




The temple is maintained by a family of wine merchants,
keen to promote the worship of Lutheria so as to serve
their business interests in the city. The high priest is
Trellus (LE cult fanatic), and he is served by six cultists
in black robes. His sister and lover, Septia (CE mage),
secretly plots to become queen of the city. The siblings
officiate in ritual kidnappings and human sacrifices, performed every full moon, although they are careful not to
kill anyone who might be missed.
Admirers of the Horn. If the two discover that the
heroes have the Horn of Balmytria, they will offer to
buy it for 5,000 gp. If the heroes refuse, then they will
secretly plot to kill the party and take it.
Quest: The Missing Casks
Recently, several wine caravans that should have reached
the temple have gone missing. The siblings believe that
bandits are hiding out in the woods near the Vineyards
of Mytros (M23). They offer 2,000 gp if the bandits can
be delivered to them alive (for use in ritual sacrifices), or
1,000 gp for the bandits' heads.
Wine Cellar of Missing Children
The wine cellar of the Temple of Lutheria is a place of
horrors. Trellus and Septia currently have thirteen children (NG commoners) locked away in the cellar, which
Septia keeps warded with the silence spell.
The children's parents were sacrificed to Lutheria, and
their bones are scattered throughout the cellar. The siblings intend to induct the children into their cult-and
sacrifice those who resist. If the children are freed, they
can be sent to Queen Vallus for protection.

M21. The Minotaur Market




This marketplace is filled with bronze cages, which
surround a central, raised platform. A rank barnyard
odor assaults your senses. Over a dozen unwashed
minotaurs have been locked within the cages. The
minotaurs are physically fit but filthy, and many have
fresh bruises and superficial cuts from battle.




Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

105

In this market, minotaur slaves can be purchased for
100-250 gp each. There are usually a dozen specimens
on display, all of which were recently captured.
There are three separate slave houses close to the
market. Each is owned by a wealthy merchant who specializes in the sale of minotaurs. The minotaurs are kept
in filthy conditions-no better than cattle pens.
Minotaurs In Mytros
The citizens of Mytros treat minotaurs as little more
than livestock, using them as opponents to be slaughtered in the funeral games held to honor the recently
deceased. This practice is mirrored and multiplied in
the Great Games, which often require hundreds of the
creatures. Although some minotaurs used in this manner
are captured from tribes in the steppes, others are captively bred for the task. These "domesticated" minotaurs
live almost universally in squalid conditions unfit for
sentient creatures.
Queen Vallus has long sought to end this barbaric
practice in the city, but King Acastus and the Order of
Sydon have undermined her at every turn. There were
a few centuries where minotaurs were merely outlawed
from the city, but widespread smuggling and other
skullduggery have ensured that the practice of slavery is
alive and well.
The party may seek to liberate the minotaurs in the
market, but it will cause chaos in this district and infuriate
the Order of Sydon. The queen would strongly approve
of such actions, but most of the district's citizens are
cowards who prefer to maintain the status quo.

Encounter: Bullbug the Minotaur
One of the minotaurs for sale is Bullbug (NG minotaur hero), a large fellow even by minotaur standards.
Bullbug calls out to the heroes, asserting that he would
make an excellent addition to their party. Despite the
conditions in the market, he is confident and friendly.
Maximus the Merciless
Maximus (LE gladiator) is the slavemaster who runs
the Minotaur Market. He keeps order in the market with
the aid of twelve thugs, and he heaps abuse upon the
minotaurs. If any of the heroes are minotaurs and they
pass through the market, he mistakes them for escaped
slaves. In this case, he approaches the hero and attempts
to shackle them, berating them for getting loose.
Treasure. Maximus carries 750 gp in his coin purse.
He also carries a permit which allows him to sell minotaurs, which was issued by Commander Gaius of the
Order of Sydon. Technically, the permit allows him to
transfer oaths of service to his customers, as outright
slavery is officially outlawed in Mytros.

THE CITY BORDERS
M22. Mount Volkan




The black, rocky crags of Mount Volkan loom over the
northern quarter of the city. At its summit, the great
mountain dips into a gently-sloping basin. Although
trees grow in abundance on the mountain's slopes, the
interior basin has been cleared to create flat fields.




The Great Games are held at the peak of Mount Volkan.
The proving grounds for the Games are inside the basinlike crater of the extinct volcano. The Great Games
are held outside of the city walls, because they are held
sacred as a neutral, non-political event. All of the Kings
of Thylea send their best to compete in the Games.

M23. The Vineyards of Mytros




You come to a vast field with row upon row of grape
vines. Although there are no obvious signs of caretakers, the vines are thriving, and fruit hangs heavy. The
plant life surrounding the vineyard is healthy-but
nowhere near as green and lush.


These vineyards are owned by a dozen mercantile families that live within the city. For centuries, these vineyards have been cared for by a tribe of satyrs.





Following the road through the vineyards, you come
to a wooded pass flanked by two large marble statues
of leering nymphs. Passing between the statues, you
enter a foggy dell carpeted by dead leaves and wild
rose bushes. In the mist ahead, you hear the sounds
of musical laughter and revelry. It seems that you've
stumbled upon a glade of fey creatures.


they've broken the oath made by their ancestors. Boreas
mocks the siblings, claiming that Lutheria will swallow their souls as punishment. He offers the heroes
his Boreal harp if they will bring him the heads of the
treacherous merchants. If the heroes comply, he will
smash the harp before handing it over.

M24. The Soldier's Gate



This is where the caravans meant for the Temple of
Lutheria (M20) have gone. Satyrs have been waylaying
the caravans and stockpiling wine casks in the glade.
Boreas (NE satyr minstrel) is here, playing a gentle
tune upon his enchanted harp. He is accompanied by his
brothers, three satyrs, who are drinking wine and entertaining a dryad. Boreas has permanently charmed a
water elemental, which tends to the vineyards for him.
The Four Winds: Boreas
Kyrah recognizes Boreas as one of The Four Winds, a troupe
of fey bards who broke into the Temple of the Five and
stole her divine instruments. The Boreal harp is one such
instrument. Recovering it by force will be a challenge.
There is a 75% chance that the harp will be destroyed
in the battle, leaving behind a set of nymph-hair strings.



This heavily-trafficked gate leads northward into the
Heartlands. During the day, the road is filled with
centurions, pilgrims, and merchants traveling between
Mytros and Estoria. At night, the road is patrolled by
soldiers with torches, who rotate shifts between a
series of stone guard towers.




This gate is always guarded by two captains and twelve
soldiers. They are replaced each hour by an identical
squad from one of the towers along the road.

M25. The Harp Bridge




This stone bridge is suspended from cascading rays of
bright copper wire. When the wind catches the wire, it
produces concordant, harp-like melodies. The songs are
joined by a chorus of beautiful voices from nearby.


Keepers of the Vineyards. Boreas claims that the
wine merchants struck a bargain with him years ago, for
which he and his brothers were to be compensated in
wine. The terms of payment were vague, but the satyrs
interpreted it as one cask per month, as long as the vineyards of Mytros remain fruitful. They claim that they
were the ones who enchanted the vineyards, centuries
ago, ensuring that the vines would flourish.
Trellus and Septia. The merchants, Trellus and
Septia, are only humans with short memories, and



This bridge is the gathering point for a flock of sirens.
There are over twenty sirens in the flock, and they live
in the estates to the west of the bridge. They gather here
throughout the day to sing together, and their collective
mood fluctuates from one day to the next.
There is a 50% chance that they will be joyful and
a 50% chance that they will be mournful. On days
when they are joyful, commerce in the city flourishes.
On days when they are mournful, the city is more
superstitious.

The Colossus of Pythor
The Colossus of Pythor (M14) is a hollow structure, but
it is sealed and guarded. In theory, only King Acastus
has the password and key to enter the Colossus but,
unbeknownst to Acastus, the Lady of Coins has tunneled up from the sewers. Her servants have built a
secret entrance into the interior of the great bronze
statue, allowing her to use this as a base of operations.

Cult of the Snake
The Cult is a thieves' guild that operates in the city's
shadows. They have a headquarters deep within the
aqueducts. The cultists have recently been breaking into

the homes of wealthy citizens, stealing everything of
value, and leaving entire families literally petrified.
The leader of the cult is a medusa who calls herself
"the Lady of Coins." She is the sister of Thesilea, the
queen of the Amazons, but she fled the Island of Themis
after a failed attempt to depose her sister. Refer to the
Island of Themis in the Cerulean Gulf for details.
Servants of Hexia. Moxena and her minions serve
the green dragon, Hexia, and they ferry their spoils to
her by ship once per year. Hexia has peculiar tastes:
she allows the cultists to keep almost everything of
material value, but she collects musical instruments

and musicians. They are transported to her in petrified form, and she releases them for entertainment
at her leisure. Refer to the Island of the Dragon in the
Forgotten Sea for details.

KEY LOCATIONS
C1. Main Entrance (Right Leg)




A circular door opens to reveal a small chamber with
a spiral staircase reaching upwards. Both the staircase
and the walls of the room are forged from bronze, but
unlike the statue's exterior, this brightly-polished metal
has not been weathered by the passage of time.






The locked and guarded main entrance is in the heel
of the right foot of the colossus. Two marble golems,
each resembling Pythor, flank the door on the outside.
If someone tries to open the door without first speaking the password, one golem's head will turn to look at
the intruder menacingly. If the intruder continues, the
marble golems will attack.
The door is locked with arcane lock. It can be picked
with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves'
tools. If the arcane lock is dispelled or suppressed with a
knock spell, the DC lowers to 15. The spell can be temporarily negated by speaking the password, "ADONIS."
This password can be obtained from Vallus.
Inside the leg, a spiral staircase ascends to the room in
the belly of the colossus (C3).

C2. Secret Entrance (Left Leg)




A small hole has been bored through the sole of the
colossus' foot. Inside is a room that has apparently
been melted out from the solid bronze. A single thug
sits at a wooden table by the hole, keeping watch.


This entrance has been bored from the sewer system,
and the room was created with the disintegrate spell.
The hole is only two feet wide, and a makeshift rope
ladder hangs down from the room in the belly of the
colossus (C3). A thug guards the entrance. If he sees
intruders, he rings a bell that hangs beside him before
taking any other actions, warning his comrades that
there are trespassers in the colossus.

This circular room contains a series of coiled bronze
tubes that snake around and overlap in a large knot
that takes up most of the chamber. One set of pipes
stretches a few feet off the ground and has four
different colored valves: yellow, red, black, and green.
Several minotaurs and a vicious-looking woman wearing an eye patch are keeping watch in here.





The belly of the colossus is filled with large tubes that
resemble intestines. These tubes do serve an important
function for the colossus, supplying the chemical biles
and humors that power the automaton. The pipes transport the biles to all of its extremities.
The Bile Traps. There are four different biles: red,
green, black, and yellow. Some of these are poisonous to
humanoids. The four valves in the chamber give access
to the different types of bile. When any bile comes into
contact with air, it turns into a gas and retains its coloration. Opening a valve takes an action, and the room fills
with gas in the next round:

• Valve 1 (Red Bile). This odorless gas will cause fits

of hilarity. Anyone who breathes it in must make a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be considered
poisoned. Affected creatures are incapacitated by a fit
of laughter for 10 rounds. The creature may repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns to shake
off the effect on a success.
• Valve 2 (Green Bile). This has a pleasant smell, but
it has a slow, progressive poisoning effect. Anyone
who breathes in green bile vapor must make a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. One round
after being poisoned, the victim will cough up mucus
and take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. On the next round,
the victim will cough up blood and take 21 (6d6)
necrotic damage. On the third round, the victim will
go into a spasm, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and
become paralyzed. Each round after being poisoned,
a victim can take an action to try and resist: a DC 15
Constitution saving throw stops the poisoning process.
• Valve 3 (Black Bile). This vapor causes extreme
sadness. Anyone who breathes it must make a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for
one minute. While poisoned, they become utterly
despondent, they have disadvantage on saving throws,
and their speed is halved.
• Valve 4 (Yellow Bile). This valve releases a harmless
yellow gas that smells like rotten eggs. The foul smell
lingers on clothing for one day, causing disadvantage
on all Charisma checks.
There are three minotaurs in here, along with the
female bandit captain. They are all resistant to the

Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

bile vapors, granting them advantage on saving throws
against the poisons. The captain tries to open the valves
one at a time while the minotaurs engage intruders. The
heroes can shut off one of the valves by using an action.

the minotaurs. The minotaurs have advantage as they
are helping each other, but the heroes can do the same.
Once the chamber has been re-opened the minotaurs
will rush forward to attack.

C4. The Statue's Torso

C5. The Statue's Chest





This curved, oblong chamber is situated between two
staircases. Small circular holes are visible throughout
the walls, ceiling, and floor of the room. Round glass
doors at each end separate staircases from the chamber. The western staircase leads downward, while the
eastern staircase leads upward. Two minotaurs stand
watch by the east door, apparently unfazed by the
sharp, acidic tang that pervades the air.


Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King



The main feature of this room is a bizarre, top-heavy
furnace that tapers to a rounded point. It hangs in
the center of the chamber from a series of pipes that
sprout from its top. Two thugs are busying themselves
with the furnace's operation while another two stand
ready at the entrance from below.




The torso chamber is a large cavity that resembles a
stomach. The doors at either end are airtight, with small
glass portholes built into them, and they are sealed shut
when the heroes arrive. Pipes enter the room from both
the ceiling and the floor.
The Acid Trap. This chamber is where the gasses
that power the colossus are made. When the colossus
is active, a powerful acidic liquid is pumped into the
chamber and then heated to become a gas. This process can be activated by using an emergency lever on
the outside of each of the exits to the chamber. If either
lever is pulled, the doors seal and acidic liquid will pour
into the chamber.
It takes two rounds for the chamber to fill. Anyone
inside the chamber during this time takes 21 (6d6) acid
damage per round. On the third round, the walls of the
room heat up to turn the liquid into gas. Anyone touching the walls takes 21 (6d6) fire damage in addition to
the 21 (6d6) acid damage. On the fourth round, the acid
becomes gas and is then pumped out of the room. At
this point, the doors open.
The process can be ended at any time by pulling either
lever to the off position, which immediately drains the
chamber and opens the doors. When the liquid is being
heated, the only other way to open the doors is to use
a knock spell or to succeed at a DC 30 Strength check
to force them. If the doors are opened in any way, the
process ends and the room immediately drains.
Two minotaurs wait on the east side of the chamber, watching for intruders. They wait until at least two
visible intruders are inside the acid chamber. Then they
move outside to pull the emergency lever. Anyone outside of the chamber at the west end will see the emergency lever move into the "ON" position, the doors will
seal, and they can clearly see what is happening to their
companions through the porthole.
Heroes outside the chamber can try to pull the lever
to the "OFF" position by testing their strength against

These are four cronies of the Lady of Coins (CE thugs).
Heart of the Colossus. The furnace here looks like
a heart, and it helps to power the colossus. It is usually
dark and cold unless the colossus is active. However, if
the thugs hear any intruders below, they will power it up
using a lever on the east side of the chamber.
The Fire Trap. Once active, the furnace begins to
rumble rhythmically, once per round. The thugs will
leave the furnace door open so that every time it "beats,"
a jet of fire explodes into the room. The blast of fire
extends from the opening in a 5 ft. wide stream to hit
the back wall. The flames do 10 (3d6) fire damage.
Anything within 5 ft. of the back wall is engulfed in
flames. The thugs know where the flames go, so they
easily avoid the blast.

C6. The Statue's Head




This spherical room is clearly the head of the colossus.
Two circular glass windows overlook the ocean to the
south. Heavy silk curtains line the rest of the chamber.
A beautiful woman wearing a platinum helmet lounges
on a hammock next to three lifelike statues of a dwarf,
an elf, and a gnome. A strange white orb swings gently
on a bronze chain at the center of the room.


The eyes of the colossus are windows that allow light
into this chamber. Behind the curtains, the walls of the
room are full length bronze mirrors, a dozen in all. A
single cord can be pulled to drop all of the silk curtains
and reveal the mirrors. Finding the cord requires a successful DC 15 Investigation check.
The milky white orb that hangs from a bronze chain
is the control mechanism for the colossus. Only someone in possession of King Acastus's rod of rulership can
activate the orb and take control of the colossus. To do
this, one must touch the rod to the orb.
The woman on the hammock is Moxena, the Lady
of Coins-and the leader of the Cult of the Snake.



THE LADY OF COINS

Moxena,
the Lady
of Coins

The Lady of Coins (TN medusa) keeps her lair in the
head of the Colossus of Pythor. Although few in the city
know it, her true name is Moxena.
Moxena commands her forces from here, using the
chamber as her personal quarters. She has set up a silk
hammock on one side of the chamber. She wears a ring
of warmth, which she expects her followers to kiss.
Statues for Hexia
There are a three statues set up around the room-victims of petrification. The victims include a bard, (Xollos,
an absent-minded CN dwarven bard), a poet (Sylla,
a shy CG elven noble) and a musician (Gondros, LN
gnomish commoner who believes he is the greatest
composer of this time, and probably ever).
Moxena intends to ship these entertainers to her mistress, Hexia, on the Island of the Dragon. If the heroes
are able to free the victims from petrification, they are
immensely grateful and swear oaths of service.

I have no patience for those who sow chaos in the name
of doing good. One must always ask: who benefits?

Battling the Lady of Coins
In combat, Moxena will pull the cord that drops
the curtains, revealing the circle of mirrors. She has
trained herself to remain focused on one target, so that
she doesn't see her own reflection. With the mirrors
revealed, Moxena's petrifying gaze affects everyone in
the room, except for targets who close their eyes. The
party may be forced to fight with the blinded condition.

the Amazons. She offers to show the heroes the way to
Themis. There they may plunder the island for its many
treasures, including the legendary sword Titansbane, a
powerful weapon that can be used against the Titans.

An Unlikely Ally
If Moxena senses that she has no chance of victory, then
she will surrender to the heroes and propose a deal: she
will join them on their quest. She has been using her
thieves' guild as a means to gather resources so that
she can make war on her sister Thesilea, the Queen of

Moxena's Treasure
There are two chests in the room. One chest contains
Moxena's personal effects, which include three random
trinkets. The other chest contains the money reserves
collected by the thieves' guild, which includes 55 pp,
450 gp, and 3,400 sp.

The Great Games
"The Great Games have a history nearly as
violent as the Aresian campaigns. It's just a bunch
of bloodthirsty barbarians tearing each other apart
over the smallest dispute. Naturally, I'm referring to
the spectators, not the athletes."
-Queen Vallus, on the Great Games
The Great Games are a series of athletic competitions
between the kingdoms of Thylea. They began four centuries ago-a centennial celebration of the Oath of Peace
and the end of the First War. While visiting Mytros, the
party has the option to engage in the competition for a
chance to win great fame and live up to their calling as
the greatest warriors in Thylea.

Purpose of the Games
The Games are held every year to honor the Oath of
Peace. Dozens of priests offer sacrifices to the Five Gods
at the start of the games. The Order of Sydon have
recently begun to participate in the Games also, bringing minotaur sacrifices for Sydon and Lutheria.
The Games are a political tool used by various factions to demonstrate their dominance. Because of this,
the Games are officiated by a neutral party-Versi, the
Oracle, whose judgment is respected by all.
Akimedes (TN mage), the Academy's arcane Master
of Divination attends and watches over every competition to ensure that no one cheats. He wears special
bronze goggles that grant him the effects of detect magic
and precise vision out to 400 feet. Cheating is penalized
by permanent expulsion from the Games.

Rewards for the Games
The victors of the Game's events are awarded special
medals that are crafted from precious metals. These
medals hold enormous value to collectors, but selling
them is frowned upon. Nevertheless, many athletes are
forced to sell their medals later in life, when they are
past their physical prime and coin runs short.
Every event awards three medals-one for each of the
top three athletes: bronze (250 gp) for third place, adamantine (500 gp) for second place, and mithral (1,000
gp) for first place. Legend has it that the Five Gods competed in the first Great Games, and "good old Pythor
won every single medal."

Joining the Competition




Before you, Mount Volkan's wide basin has been
transformed into a grand stadium. Dozens of running
tracks and courts have been set up for a wide variety
of events. Rows of stone benches have been hewed
into the mountainside, seating throngs of onlookers.
Thunderous chanting, cheers, and celebratory music
echo through the stadium. Both the athletes and the
spectators hail from across Thylea, and they wear all
sorts of exotic armor and colorful clothing.


The heroes can enter and compete in the Games, but
first they must pass a trial. Entering a trial costs a single
silver piece. The hero must win the trial in order to
compete in the official event.



The Athletes
Every settlement in Thylea sends its best athletes to
compete in the Great Games. Competing this year are
the following athletes:

• Cy (LN warrior monk) from the kingdom of Aresia.

He is famed across Thylea for his accomplishments in
previous Games. The citizens of Mytros hate him.
• Egan (LG veteran) representing Estoria. He is an
older competitor with more than a dozen Games
under his widening belt.
• Falana (CG noble) is a glamorous bard from Estoria.
She brings a legion of adoring teenaged fans from the
outlying settlements who cheer themselves hoarse.
• Hatria (CE amazon warrior) is a warrior and the first
ever Amazon to compete in any Games. She is aloof
and treated coldly by the other competitors.
• Jorges (LE captain) of the Order of Sydon. He is arrogant and pompous and has an intense dislike for the
heroes, particularly those who join the Games.
• Leyland (CG gladiator) represents Mytros and is a
favorite of the home crowd. He is considered one of
the greatest athletes of this generation.
• Pancras (CG oread) is a nymph from the distant
northern steppes. He is quite an exotic figure, and is
treated with curiosity by the other athletes.
• Spira (NG soldier) is an underdog who suffered
an injury five years ago and is only now recovered
enough to participate. The crowd loves her. She has a
Strength score of 16 (+3) and Athletics of +5.

Daily Sacrifice
At the start of each day, animal sacrifices are made to
each of the gods. These are carried out with solemnity,
after requesting a moment of silence from spectators.
Minotaur Battle. Recently, the Order of Sydon has
started a new tradition: a battle to the death against a
minotaur. This sacrifice to the Titans requires five athletes to work together to take down one minotaur.
If one of the heroes wants to be involved in a sacrificial event, they can volunteer. If a hero volunteers to
fight alone against the minotaur, then the other athletes
will step aside. Besting a minotaur in single combat
brings great honor and attracts crowds of onlookers, but
there is no reward for winning other than the fame (and
the pointed disapproval of Queen Vallus).

Optional Event: Bullbug
If you want, you can replace the minotaur with Bullbug
(NG minotaur hero) from the Minotaur Market (M21).
Bullbug calls out a challenge to the heroes to fight him.
If one of the heroes can beat him in good-natured single
combat, he will agree to join their crew. While this is
highly unusual, Queen Vallus will overrule the protests of
the Order of Sydon.

Daily Competitions
These are the competitions that make up the Great
Games. One competition is held each day, over a series
of seven days, with celebrations every night.
Partners
Each contestant can choose a partner to magically
augment them. This partner is allowed to use any magic
available to them. Most of the lesser athletes can't afford
magical aid. Those who can afford it are aided by an
acolyte (who provides the bless spell).
Well-known athletes have access to a mage or priest.
These spell casters prepare spells such as bless, enhance
ability, longstrider, or haste. Partners who target anyone
but their chosen athlete are immediately disqualified, as
is the athlete that they were aiding.
Magic in the Great Games
Thyleans decided long ago that trying to stop magic
manipulation in the Great Games was pointless, hence
the ruling allowing a magical partner to augment an athlete. It also allows heroes that aren't directly involved in a
competition to be part of the action.

Jumping
A hero must first succeed in a trial jumping event
against four other competitors (LN guards). Only one of
the other competitors will try and jump farther than the
standard jump.

In the actual jumping competition, the heroes will
have to compete against Spira, Leyland, Hatria and
Egan. A competitor can choose to perform a standard
jump, which will result in a long jump that is equivalent
to the Strength score of the competitor.
However, a competitor can also try to go further than
the standard jump. This requires a DC 15 Athletics
check. Failure means that the competitor lands 1-4 (1d4)
ft. short of the standard jump distance. A success adds
1 ft., with an additional 1 ft. for every 3 points rolled
above 15 (e.g. DC 18, DC 21, etc). Refer to page 182 of
the 5th Edition Player's Book for rules on long jumping.
Running
To qualify for this event, a hero must first succeed in
a trial event against four other competitors (two LN
guards and two CG scouts).
Competitors. In the actual event, the heroes compete
against Spira, Leyland, Hatria, and Pancras.
This is a 1000 ft. run divided into six race stages. All of
the runners must roll for initiative at the start. Whoever
wins initiative gains advantage on the first check to
move into the 'ahead' state. This starting advantage lasts
for the first three stages of the race.
Pulling Ahead. At each stage of the race, each racer
may choose to pull ahead. To pull ahead a runner must
make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
This DC increases by 1 at each subsequent stage (e.g.
DC 16, DC 17, etc). Failure means the runner gets one
level of exhaustion. A successful check means that the
runner is now considered to be in the 'ahead' state.
Once a runner has pulled ahead they must make a
successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end
of every stage. Failure means they gain one level of
exhaustion and they are no longer considered ahead.
When a runner has two levels of exhaustion, they collapse and are disqualified from the race.
The Final Stage. At the sixth and final stage of
the race, every runner who is considered ahead has
a chance for a medal. They all must make Athletics
checks, with the highest check winning first place, and
the next two taking second and third.
If there are not enough runners who are considered
ahead, then after determining the finishing order with
the ahead racers, repeat this with the rest of the runners
except for those who have collapsed.
Javelin Throwing
To qualify for this event, a hero must first succeed in a
trial event against three young men (LG guards) and
one woman (CN scout).
Competitors. In the actual event, the heroes compete
against Falana, Leyland, Hatria, and Pancras.
Each competitor makes three javelin throws, and their
best throw determines how they place.
Calculating Throws. With each throw, a competitor rolls d20 and adds their Athletics, Acrobatics, or
Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

113

Dexterity bonus (the competitor's choice). This bonus
is multiplied by 3 and added to the base javelin range
of 120 ft. For example, a competitor with Dexterity 14,
Athletics +2, Acrobatics +5 rolls a 15 and chooses to
add the +5 from Acrobatics for a total of 20. This total
is multiplied by 3 to become 60 ft. which is added to the
base javelin range of 120 ft. for a total of 180 ft.
Discus Throwing
To qualify for this event, a hero must first succeed in a
trial event against three young men (LG guards) and
one woman (CN scout).
In the actual competition, the heroes will compete
against Falana, Leyland, Hatria, and Jorges.
Each competitor has three attempts at the discus
throw. The mechanics work in the same fashion as the
javelin throw, but the base range of the discus is 90 ft.
Wrestling
This event uses the grappling rules described on pg. 195
of the 5th Edition Player's Book.
To qualify for this event, a hero must prove themselves against Crusher, a drunken black bear who
drinks large quantities of fermented honeywine before
the match. Crusher is a crowd favorite.
In order to win this event, a hero must win two grapple attempts in a row. Roll for initiative at the start. The
first successful attempt means getting a hold, while the
second successful attempt means getting the pin.
Competitors. In the main event, the hero must wrestle against Egan (for third place), then Cy (for second
place), and finally Jorges (for first place).
Boxing
This event uses the unarmed combat rules described on
pg. 195 of the 5th Edition Player's Book.
To qualify for this event, a hero must defeat Smasher,
another black bear like the one from the wrestling
event. Smasher is fitted with bronze-plated gloves.
Competitors. In the main event, the hero must box
against Spira (for third place), then Jorges (for second
place) and finally Cy (for first place).
Monk characters have an obvious advantage in this
event. The first person to be rendered unconscious is
the loser. Roll for initiative before each match.

The Great Relay
The great relay is the prestige event of the Great Games.
It requires teams of five to compete in a five-stage relay
race. In order to compete in the Great Relay, an athlete
must have placed in a previous event. Alternatively, they
may be sponsored by another winning athlete.
Competing Teams
There are three teams; competing heroes are the fourth
team. The named contestants anchor the fourth and
fifth legs of the Great Relay. If the heroes are unable to
114

Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

assemble a full team, they can try to convince one of the
other athletes to join them.

• Mytros: Spira, Leyland, and three soldiers
• Estoria: Egan, Felana, and three scouts
• Aresia: Jorges, Hatria, and three thugs
Parts of the Race
Each member of the team must be assigned to run a
leg of the relay. Once selected, they must stand at the
starting point of that relay. They are not allowed to start
running their leg of the relay until they are tagged by the
team member from the previous leg.
Winning Points. At the start of each leg of the race,
the athlete can choose to go at standard speed or fast.
Going at standard speed earns 1 point, while going fast
earns 2 points. Failing a required check for the leg at
either speed results in 0 points, though the athlete still
finishes the leg. These points will be totaled at the end
of the relay to determine the winning team.
If any single athlete is caught or reduced to 0 hit
points by one of the obstacles along the way, then that
team loses the entire race.
First Leg: The Beach Run
The athlete must make a dash over 300 ft. of sand. A
standard run requires a successful DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check, while a fast sprint requires DC 15.
Lions. Partway down the beach, trap-doors burst
open (one for each team) spraying sand everywhere
and releasing a muzzled lion. Each lion goes for one
of the sprinters and uses its pounce action. An athlete
knocked prone by the lion is out of the race. Lions
have disadvantage on attacks against athletes who are
going fast.
Second Leg: The Underwater Swim
Magic has been used to freeze over one of the mountain
lakes. Each athlete must dive into a hole in the ice, swim
underwater for 300 ft., and then resurface. A standard
swim requires a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics)
check, while a fast swim requires DC 18. Anyone with
swim speed on their character sheet gets advantage on
this roll.
Third Leg: The Cliff Climb
Each athlete must climb up a sheer cliff face. A standard
climb requires a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics)
check, while a fast climb requires DC 18. Anyone with a
climb speed on their character sheet gets advantage on
this roll.
Fourth Leg: The Fire Dash
The athlete must sprint across a bed of hot coals and
fire snakes. A standard run requires a successful DC 10
Strength (Athletics) check, while a fast sprint requires
DC 15. A standard run causes 7 (2d6) fire damage to the
athlete, while a fast sprint causes no damage.

Anyone who fails either check takes 10 (3d6) fire
damage. There are six fire snakes amongst the coals, and
two of them will attack any runner moving at standard
speed. Only one fire snake will be provoked to attack by
fast runners. Anyone who fails their checks provokes all
six into attacking.

King Acastus takes this opportunity to steal as much
glory from the victors as he can. He is sensitive to what
pleases the crowd, and the people of his city absolutely
adore him. The king hands out the appropriate awards
the victors. The greatest athlete is awarded the crown of
laurels. There is no monetary reward for winning.

Fifth Leg: The Harpy Cages
The athletes must race across 300 ft. of beach. Along
the beach are three bronze cages, each with a harpy.
A standard run requires a successful DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check, while a fast sprint requires DC 15.
Harpy Songs. Each athlete must make three DC 11
Wisdom saving throws to resist the songs of the three
harpies. Athletes can choose to cover their ears with
their hands, but this adds 2 to the DC of the running
check. However, it gives them advantage on their
Wisdom saving throw against being charmed.

Treasure
The medals are cheaply-made, but they are prized by the
people of Mytros and can easily be sold to merchants in
Stygian Row. The first place medal is valued at 1,000 gp,
the second place medal is valued at 500 gp, and the third
place medal is valued at 250 gp.
Awarding Experience
You should award 300 XP for participation in each of the
six lesser events. Participation in the Great Relay should
be rewarded with 900 XP. Participation in every event
is worth a total of 2,700 XP, which is enough to bring a
fresh character up to level four. If the heroes are higher
than sixth level, you may double these XP awards to make
participation more attractive.

Ending the Race
At the end of the race, the team with the most points
wins. The crowd reacts with great enthusiasm when
each team finishes the race.

The Award Ceremony




If any of the heroes were victorious, then they are
approached by two tavern owners from Mytros,
Ambrosia from The Siren's Roost (M18) and Julius from
The Satyr's Tail (M19). They hate each other, but both
of them want a sponsorship deal with the winner of the
Great Games. Such an individual would attract a great
deal of business to their taverns. The heroes can choose
the offer they like best, or they can try to persuade Julius
and Ambrosia to enter a bidding war.
Julius initially offers 1,000 gp and free wine for life,
although he can be persuaded to offer as much as 3,000
gp. Ambrosia offers 1,000 gp and a night of pleasure-
on the house, naturally. She will go no higher than 2,000
gp, but she points out that Julius is a greedy fool, and
associating with him will tarnish the heroes' names.

Suddenly, there is a thunder of noise from the stands
as everyone leaps to their feet and points at the sky
with excitement. Descending from the clouds is a
huge silver dragon. On its back rides a crowned figure,
cloaked in red. The spectators cheer in unison. "It's
King Acastus! King Acastus has come to honor the
victors of the Great Games!"
The silver dragon touches down at the center of the
colosseum, and the king dismounts with a flourish,
waving to the crowd with a broad smile. He carries
several shiny medals in one hand, and a crown of
laurels in the other. Approaching the row of victorious
athletes, he mounts a small stone platform where he
can address the thousands of people in the stands.
"PEOPLE OF MYTROS! My dear people, has this
not been the most exciting contest in living memory? I
have always loved the Great Games, and it has been my
pleasure to continue sponsoring them, even in these
darkest of days. Indeed, I believe that even the gods
themselves are watching, and smiling upon us! I offer
my sincerest congratulations to these fine men and
women-the greatest athletes in all of Thylea!"
The crowd thunders their approval, and hundreds of
flowers are cast into the arena at the king's feet.


Tavern Sponsorships

There is much to be gained by winning the Great
Games of Mytros. First, they were born out of training
exercises devised by the Dragonlords, so they may help
keep your wits and reflexes sharp. Second, they are
immensely popular throughout Thylea, and the names of


the victors will live on throughout history. Third, it is a
chance to prove to yourself that you are ready for the
trials that surely lie ahead.

The Ghost Ship Ultros
King Acastus has given the heroes a map to the Ultros,
the legendary ship captained by his ancestor, Estor
Arkelander. Acastus claims that his scouts have sighted
the ship at the Dead Falls. In fact, he has long known the
ship's location, because his ancestor's ghost haunts his
dreams. Estor hopes to lure one of his mortal descendants to the Ultros so that he may possess a warrior's
body and take vengeance upon the Titans.




The time has come to complete the next of your Great
Labors. King Acastus gave you a map to the last known
whereabouts of the legendary Ultros, but its location
seems ominous. The ship was last seen near the Dead
Falls in the rocky wastelands of the eastern Heartlands.
You've heard stories of the Ultros. It was captained
by Estor Arkelander the Dragonlord, leader of a savage
and bloodthirsty crew. He savaged the islands of
Thylea, leaving slaughter in his wake. Sydon unleashed
his full fury against the vessel, attempting to smash
it with hundred-foot waves and drag it down to the
bottom of the sea with terrifying whirlpools. But the
magic of the Ultros was so powerful that even the Lord
of Storms could not sink it.
The ship and its crew went missing several years
after the end of the First War. You must find it and take
command of it, for you cannot brave the waters of the
Forgotten Sea without it.


Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

The Ghost Ship's Crew
Estor Arkelander's ghost is captain of the Ultros. Seventy
ghosts and specters are the crew under his command,
all of them Estor's thanes. The specters are crewmen
who have lost their sanity and been reduced to soulless
undead shades with no personality or drive.
Estor has been waiting for a band of warriors to board
his ship. He wants a new body, and possessing a great
hero will do nicely. For years, he has tried to lure King
Acastus to his ship, but his descendant is a cowardly
disappointment. He knows that Acastus has sent the
heroes in his place, and he plans to haunt their dreams
to discover the worthiest amongst them. He will mark
the worthiest hero as the warrior he intends to possess.
The Ultros is usually docked in an inlet near the Dead
Falls. Rarely, it ventures northward along the River
Lethe. The ghostly crew of the Ultros are deathly afraid
of the horrors of the Nether Sea, but they are nevertheless drawn to the chasm at the Dead Falls. The necromantic energy from the Nether Sea makes them feel
almost alive again.
A Pristine Vessel
For a ghost ship, the Ultros is surprisingly well-maintained. The ghostly crew keep the ship in perfect condition and clean it every day, by order of the captain. Estor
still takes pride in his ship. It is, perhaps, the only thing
that he has ever truly loved.

TRAVELING TO
THE DEAD FALLS

or be swept away and over the falls. A path leads along
the edge of the rapids: it is soaking wet but otherwise
safe to travel.

Traveling to the Dead Falls from Mytros or Estoria
takes about two days and requires the party to wayfind
through forests and rocky hills. You may choose to run
1-2 random land encounters along the way.

Encounter: The Gates of Death


The path along the rapids twists and turns, and the
sides of the canyon seem to be closing in around you.
The walls are adorned with horrific carvings of what
seem to be faces, both human and inhuman.

Return to The Sour Vintage
Located about halfway to the Dead Falls, the Sour
Vintage tavern makes a convenient place to stop for
a rest. Aetala now advertises the tavern as the place
where the "Heroes of the Prophecy" gathered before
slaying the Great Boar. She cheerfully offers the party
free accommodations, and her patrons ensure that the
heroes drink for free.







As you make your way further down the path, the
canyon continues to grow narrower. Cold winds assail
you, howling through the canyon with a blood-curdling
sound like an inhuman scream.


Rumors of the Dead Falls
The patrons of the Sour Vintage know a few tales of
Dead Falls. They say it's one of the pathways to the
Underworld, the domain of Lutheria, Lady of Dreams.
Strange things happen there. People say the rocks
scream like harpies, and those who venture to the river's
end never return. But there is an oft-repeated mantra
that the patrons use to reassure the party:
"Heroes have no fear of the dead!"

THE FALLS OF THE
UNDERWORLD

The king's map points to a secret inlet at Dead Falls,
located just before the River Lethe rushes into a huge
chasm. The Ultros is supposedly docked at this inlet
every night in the hours before dawn. Getting to the
ship's mooring requires walking along the river's rapids
and passing through a narrow canyon. The heroes
should arrive at midnight.



A passive Perception score of 12 or higher reveals
that the cliffs are moving together, and that the wailing seems to be coming from the mouths of the faces.
Heroes who notice this have one round to react.
On the next round, it becomes obvious that the cliffs
are moving. The cliff path pushes up against the other
side of the canyon, and the water beneath vanishes
under the rocks. Anyone still on the path at this time
must move 80 ft. to get to safety. Failure to escape
means that they will become stuck between the rocks.
Escaping. A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics)
check allows a stuck hero to squeeze through to safety.
Failure means that they take 20 (6d6) bludgeoning
damage. Every round after that, they can make another
check to escape. The damage increases by 20 (6d6) on
each subsequent round. Anyone reduced to 0 hit points
is instantly killed, and reduced to a meaty paste.
After five rounds, the cliffs return to their original
position with the gore of any unfortunate victims plastered across the cliff walls.

The Dead Falls

The Rapids






The rapids are too dangerous to travel by boat or to
swim. If someone tries to swim across, they must make a
successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check every round



As the rapids twist and turn, you approach what
appears to be a massive waterfall. The water of the
river pours into a vast, shadowy chasm and vanishes.
The sight is beautiful, but you find it disconcerting
that such a large river could come to such a sudden
end. The thundering sound that typically accompanies
waterfalls is strangely absent here. It's as if the water
and the noise have been swallowed by a void.

The River Lethe descends further and faster and breaks
up into frothing rapids. The water flows and gurgles
at a treacherous speed. Large, sharp rocks jut from the
water, making the river even more perilous.




The path leads to a section of the rapids at the canyon's
narrowest point, with only 20 ft. between the cliff faces.
Each wall at first appears to be carved with horrifying
faces, but upon closer examination, it seems that they
might actually be mundane rock formations.

Rumors of the Ultros
Everyone knows of the Ultros. It's Estor Arkelander's
ship from the legendary adventures of the Dragonlords!
Several fishermen claim to have seen the ship sailing
down the River Lethe at midnight, but no one believes
them. Why would a ghost ship be sailing on a landlocked
river?

Here the River Lethe pours into a chasm, creating a
waterfall that plunges for more than one vertical mile into
the Underworld, which explains the strange lack of sound.
Anyone who spills over the edge will fall for 20 seconds
before colliding with the primordial waters of the Nether
Sea, suffering 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage.
The secret inlet is shown on the king's map, but its
location is not obvious at first glance. With some trivial
investigation, the heroes will discover a switchback
rocky passage that leads to the inlet. The passage is
flooded by water (5 ft. deep), which the heroes must
wade or swim through.
Investigation: The Secret Inlet




You discover an inlet near the chasm where the river's
waters are eerily still. The canyon walls surround a
small lake, protecting it from the rush of the nearby
rapids. Moonlight shines down through the clouds,
illuminating a beautiful ship moored alongside the
rocky shore.
This ship is large, and of fine workmanship, though
its design is ancient. Its sails are black, and the prow is
carved into the likeness of a dragon. You see no crew
aboard and you hear only silence.




Before the Dream
The top deck is empty. When anyone first boards the
Ultros, they will notice the cold, and anyone staying on
the top deck for more than a few minutes will begin to
hear whispering. They will also see the ghostly crew
members out of the corners of their eyes. As soon as
anyone tries to focus on the sights and sounds, they will
suddenly cease, only to resume a few minutes later.
During the Dream
There are six specters on the main deck, but they are
not immediately hostile. They don't acknowledge the
heroes in any way.
The Quartermaster. At the steering wheel at the
rear of the ship is the ghost of the dwarf, Davos, one of
Estor's thanes. He is singing a randy song to inspire the
crew as they go about their tasks (the specters are not
impressed). When he notices the heroes, he will end his
song and call upon the crew to slay the intruders.
The specters are hesitant to come to Davos's aid, with
only one of them joining the battle each round. Once
Davos is destroyed, the specters return to their duties.
Davos starts off the battle by tearing the flesh from his
face in order to use his horrifying visage. After that, he
tries to possess one of the heroes.

U2. Storage Cabin

The Ultros is anchored in this lake, but it's impossible to
see how it got here. It is impossible for it to fit through
the passage that the party used. The heroes may freely
walk along the rocky shore to the ship and board it.
Nothing stands in their way.



KEY LOCATIONS

This room is empty of crew at all times. There is no
difference before or during the dream.
Treasure. There is a small locked iron box that can be
opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using
thieves' tools. Inside are six burnished dragonlord coins,
75 sp, 35 gp, and a small leatherbound journal.
The journal gives a detailed account of Estor
Arkelander's role in starting the First War 500 years
ago. Refer to Estor Arkelander and the First War in the
Secrets and Myths appendix for details.



U1. The Top Deck




On the top deck of the ship, you feel a chill in the air.
The ship appears abandoned, though it is well maintained. Listening carefully, you hear faint whispering
and then sense movement around you as though from
crewmen at work. For a moment, you think you can
hear boisterous singing from the back of the ship but,
when you turn to look, there is nothing.




Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

The oar deck is clean, orderly and built to house 25 oars
on each side of the ship. At each oar sits a single, silent
man. Upon second glance, each of them appears to be
translucent and partially decomposed.

During this adventure, the heroes will experience a
strange dream during which the ship's ghostly crew
become visible. Refer to the During the Dream sections

day or night in the dream. Refer to the Before the Dream
sections when the heroes are first exploring the ship.

This small storage cabin houses all of the necessary
provisions for a short journey out to sea. There is an
ancient chest in the corner. It appears to be locked.

one oar each, which means that there are 56 specters
on this deck. They have lost their sanity, and their souls
have withered, so they are all silent and do not interact
with anyone. If attacked, an oarsman specter will cower
but will not actively defend itself or attack.
The Undead Drummer. At the rear of the oar deck is
an undead woman sitting by a drum. Her skin is white as
bone and her eyes are missing. She has the statistics of
a revenant, but she does not have a focus for vengeance.
She is not hostile, but she will defend herself if attacked.
If destroyed, she will return within 24 hours, rising out
of the river or the ocean to resume her place.
The drum-beater will ask one simple question in a
whispering voice: "Are you ready to travel to Mytros?"
She won't communicate in any other way. If the heroes
say yes, she will begin to beat her drum. The specters
will begin to row. Once this happens, read the following:




The Ultros raises anchor and smoothly sets sail toward
the canyon wall. The cliff looms closer and closer
as the ship picks up speed, as if preparing to smash
through the rocks. Just when it seems like the ship
must collide with the wall, it suddenly dives underwater. The decks of the Ultros flood with water as it
submerges, and you are forced to hold your breath.
The ship travels at a terrific speed, rushing past large
aquatic creatures and shadowy rock formations. Your
lungs ache with the effort of holding your breath but,
finally, the ship surfaces. You find yourself surrounded
on all sides by the gentle waters of the Cerulean Gulf.


A ghostly figure rises out of the floor and speaks:
"Estor sends you to destroy me. You are fools to trust
him!" The ghost calls for his sword and armor: "Ebony,
Azurescale-arise and slay these intruders!"




Skathon was a powerful warrior in life. He possessed
a set of magical scale mail and a magical sword. These
items hang on the wall at the back of the cabin. The
sword will rise into the air and attack as an animated
sword, while the armor will attack as animated armor.
Once the fight has started, Skathon will leave the ethereal plane and try to possess a hero.
Treasure. Azurescale is a set of scale mail mariner's
armor, and Ebony is a +1 mithral makhaira.



You enter a large room with six hammocks gently
swaying with the ship. The room is otherwise bare, but
there is a strange, ornate box sitting in one corner.

U4. The Captain's Cabin


This cabin is more luxurious than the rest of the ship.
The bedding is made of finely-spun silk, as are the
curtains at the window. The wallpaper is textured with
gold filigree. The wooden floor and furniture has been
recently cleaned and waxed, and the room has a fresh,
clean smell. There is a desk at the rear of the room with
scattered papers and a journal.

Before the Dream
The leatherbound journal contains several entries. It is
written in the hand of Estor Arkelander, and it recounts
the history of the Ultros. Refer to Estor Arkelander and
the Curse in the Secrets and Myths appendix.

The Dream Begins
The ship now begins its journey to Mytros, but something strange is afoot. Refer to the Visions of the Past
section below to determine what happens next.



U5. The Thanes' Quarters





During the Dream
The First Mate. In this cabin is the ghost of one of
Estor's thanes, Skathon. Skathon is deep in the ethereal
plane most of the time. Anyone who enters the room
feels cold and is assaulted by strange feelings of anger
and guilt. Skathon appears before them, still in the
border ethereal (and thus immune to attack).
Read the following.







Before the Dream
The ornate box is attached to the floor and secured with
an arcane lock. It can be opened with a successful DC 25
Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the arcane lock is
dispelled or suppressed with a knock spell, then the DC
is lowered to 15.
Treasure. Inside the box are 16 onyx gemstones. If
the gems are removed from the box, each transforms
into a specter after one round (see the During the
Dream section below for more details). The specters
immediately attack the hero who took them from the
box. The spectral onyxes have no value, as they are not
true gems. Any specters killed before the dream will not
be able to serve Metron later (see below).
During the Dream
The Navigator. The ghost of Metron the thane is in
here. One of the hammocks obviously sags more than
the others when the heroes enter and then, a round later,
Metron will fade into sight, though he will remain in
the border of the ethereal plane. He claims to be from
a lost undersea kingdom, but he's forgotten its name.
He served as navigator aboard the Ultros, charting new
paths across Thylea's oceans.
Ch apter 3 - Summoned by the King

121

The Vengeful Spirits. Metron will tell the heroes that
the captain was a cruel man, one who was responsible
for untold thousands of deaths. Many of those unfortunate souls have traveled from the underworld in search
of vengeance, and Metron has sealed them away in a
box. He asks if the heroes would be kind enough to help
dispose of the troublesome spirits.
With a flick of his hand, the ornate box opens, and
vengeful spirits swarm out of it over the next four
rounds. Each spirit is a specter that attacks the heroes
relentlessly. The horrifying forms that they take do not
affect their statistics:

The storage deck is accessible via a stairway that
descends from the Thane's Quarters (U5). The chests
and crates here are remarkably well preserved and
usable, but they are all empty.

VISIONS OF THE PAST

Once the heroes have spoken to the undead drummer
on the oar deck of the Ultros, they will begin their journey across the Cerulean Gulf towards Mytros.
On the first night of this voyage, the party becomes
trapped in a waking dream:

If someone closes the box, then the specters will stop
appearing. Once the box has been closed or the specters
have been vanquished, Metron leaves the ethereal plane
and attempts to possess one of the heroes. He prefers a
hero with strong arms and legs for swimming.


U6. The Storage Hold




Stepping onto the hold, you're struck by the number of
empty crates and boxes strewn about. Clearly this deck
once housed many stores for the ship.




You fall asleep to the gentle rocking of the ship and
the sound of waves lapping against the hull. Your sleep
takes you on a journey to a distant time, sailing on a
distant sea. The sky above is strange and otherworldly.
You stand on the deck of the Ultros, surrounded by
dozens of men and women with grim faces and ancient
weapons. You are part of the ship's crew, and you know
that you have served the captain in countless battles.
Standing at the prow of the ship is a tall man with
long, gray dreadlocks. His engraved bronze pauldrons
mark him as one of the legendary Dragonlords. This is
Estor Arkelander. He calls his entire crew to the deck.





The Ultros is sailing on a strange expanse of foggy, gray
ocean. All the doors on the ship are now unlocked, and
all rooms and their contents can be searched. The ghost
of Estor Arkelander now stands near the ship's mast,
gazing out into the void. He has called upon the strange
magic of the ship to create this dream.




Estor speaks in a deep, rasping voice.
"I have summoned you here for a grave purpose.
Tomorrow I walk into the fires of Typhon and become
like a god. Thenceforth I shall be immortal, perhaps
even as powerful as Kentimane, the Hundred-Handed.
But I shall no longer call myself captain of this ship.
"It has been a great honor to fight alongside you in the
war against the Gygans. We have toppled their wretched
cities, and flooded the oceans with their blood. But now,
it is time for me to choose a worthy successor: a new
captain for the Ultros.
"I will choose the new captain from among my loyal
thanes. Each of you swore a blood oath to serve me. I
call upon you to swear that same oath upon the Ultros.
Only then will she follow your commands as she has
done mine."

Estor
Arkelander



Estor identifies the heroes as his new thanes, and he
asks each of them to swear the following oath.







"I swear upon my life's blood that I shall captain the
Ultros with honor. Even should we sail into the maw of
the Nether Sea, my fate shall be bound to hers."


Estor's curse prevents him from taking possession of a
hero without their consent. This bargain is a trap and, if
anyone accepts his offer, Estor immediately takes possession of that hero for the next hour.



Players may excuse themselves from consideration
to be captain if they want to avoid swearing the oath.
However, the Ultros will only heed the commands of
heroes who have sworn the oath.

Estor's Bargain
Accepting the bargain means that the hero's personality
immediately changes: they become dangerously cruel
and obsessed with achieving immortality, and their
alignment shifts to neutral evil. Estor speaks constantly
in their mind, always encouraging the pursuit of power at
any cost. His goal is to wear down the hero's willpower
so that he can eventually take permanent control. Once
per day, Estor's spirit can take control of the hero for one
round without a chance to save.
Eventually, Estor's control over the hero may become
permanent (which forces the character to retire as an
NPC), but this should only happen if the player's behavior
has become too disruptive to the rest of the party.

Quest: The Traitorous Thanes
After oaths are sworn, Estor announces that there are
three traitors among his crew. He tasks the heroes with
finding the traitorous ghosts and destroying them.
He refuses to release the heroes from the dream until
this has been accomplished. He explains that whoever
performs most admirably will take his place as the new
captain of the ship.
Estor's Deception. Estor does not plan to relinquish
control of the ship. Rather than choosing a successor, he
hopes to possess the body of the hero who proves to be
the strongest during the following trial.

If no one accepts Estor's bargain, then he is confined
to the captain's quarters, and he becomes absolutely
furious at the party. Anyone who swore the oath to the
ship may command it. One hero should be elected or
chosen to serve as the ship's captain.

The Traitorous Thanes
Estor Arkelander was originally served by three traitorous thanes, Davos, Metron, and Skathon, and they
now haunt the Ultros as ghosts. The three ghosts will
appear in different sections of the Ultros.

RETURN TO MYTROS

The ship returns to Mytros, where the heroes are
received by a crowd of onlookers. News of the arrival of
the Ultros has spread through the city like wildfire. The
king and queen have also come to meet the heroes.

• Davos, the Quartermaster. He is a dwarven ghost
who can be found on the top deck (U1).

• Metron, the Navigator. He is a lazy ghost who can be
found in the thane's quarters (U5).

• Skathon, the First Mate. He is a powerful warrior



When you arrive back in Mytros, Queen Vallus is waiting for you at the docks, accompanied by her retinue.
But before she can greet you, a silver dragon descends
from the heavens toward the Ultros. It passes overhead
and lands on the docks ahead. King Acastus slides off
of the back of the dragon to stand gracefully beside it.
"You are great warriors indeed, to have taken command of my ancestor's ship... but the Ultros is a relic
from bygone days. To stand up to the power of the
Titans, we will need dragons-not ancient ships."

who can be found in the captain's cabin (U4).

The Traitors are Destroyed
When the ghost of the last traitorous thane has been
destroyed, the fog surrounding the Ultros lifts, and the
heroes awaken from the dream. Any heroes who were
killed during the dream wake with two levels of exhaustion, but they are otherwise fine.
The New Captain
The ghost of Estor Arkelander awaits the heroes in the
captain's quarters. He is now satisfied that the heroes
are stronger than his previous thanes. He chooses the
hero who performed most admirably during the trial
and appoints them captain. If they refuse the bargain, he
grumpily offers it to someone else.




"You have all proven yourselves worthy to command
this ship. But one of you in particular has shown that
you are worthy to be captain. I offer you the honor of
being my successor. You will know power beyond anything you could possibly imagine. Do you accept?"










King Acastus has come to upstage the party. He is
secretly furious that the heroes were not killed by the
ghost of his ancestor. He coldly congratulates them on
their success and introduces his splendid dragon, Icarus.
He emphasizes that the Ultros is an ancient relic-hardly
as impressive as his dragons.
Queen Vallus brushes her husband aside and proclaims that the city of Mytros needs the heroes now
more than ever. She frowns and wonders how the Ultros
made it to Mytros with no crew. It appears that all of the
specters that haunted the ship have vanished.

• Seeking the services of the temples.
• Purchasing provisions and sacrificial animals.
• Purchasing wine for the ship's consecration.

THE EMBARKATION

As soon as the heroes arrive back in Mytros, Kyrah
will urge them to set sail as soon as possible. Time is of
the essence, and King Acastus may be plotting against
the party. He hates that the party's fame is beginning
to eclipse his own, and he wants them gone as soon as
possible. It would be wise to move on quickly.

Ch apter 4 - Voyage of the Ultros



Word of your imminent departure has spread quickly:
the provisioning of your legendary ship did not go
unnoticed. A sizable crowd of onlookers has gathered
to see you off, and two figures of note have also come
to speak with you: the king and queen of the city.
King Acastus is mounted on the back of his silver
dragon, watching you with narrowed eyes. "I wish you
well on your journey. Take care that you do not invite
new troubles upon my city." With that, the king spurs
his dragon and flies away toward the palace.
Queen Vallus arrives in her chariot. She climbs down
and glides toward you with divine poise, while her attendants run before her, laying several baskets at your feet.
"Heroes of the Prophecy, I bring you gifts from the people
of Mytros. And I have come to give you my blessing. But
I must speak with you privately before you embark."


Gifts from Citizens
Vallus has brought many gifts from the people of
Mytros. These include four goats and two white cows
from some of Mytros's most respected farmers; a quiver



Legendary Crew

of ten +1 arrows from the city's centurions; and six
potions of healing, four potions of climbing, and four
potions of resistance from the Academy.

Vallus tells the heroes that she sent out a call for
those who would be willing to travel on the Ultros,
and many have responded. She introduces them to
the heroes:

The Antikythera
The greatest gift that Vallus gives to the heroes is the
Antikythera. This is a legendary magical device that will
allow the heroes to navigate through the islands of the
Cerulean Gulf and the Forgotten Sea.




The Goddess of Wisdom hands you a strange device.
"As you know, the Cerulean Gulf and the Forgotten
Sea are vast and harbor many dangers. Some of your
destinations may even vanish and shift by the workings of capricious primal powers. The Antikythera is a
cunning device. It utilizes both magic and mechanical
ingenuity to chart a safe path across the oceans."
"Every island is attuned with a particular constellation in the night sky. By selecting a constellation on the
device, you may chart a course to its associated island.
"Unfortunately, it seems that someone has stolen
a gear from the device. Until the gear is replaced, you
will not be able to navigate into the Forgotten Sea.
"I suspect that the Order of Sydon is responsible for
this theft-in which case, Gaius almost certainly has
the piece. He departed yesterday for the Order's headquarters on the island of Yonder."


Pythor, God of Battle
Pythor has abdicated his throne in Estoria and handed
power to his daughter Anora, so that he can join the
heroes on their voyage. Despite his desire to help them
in their quest, he has been drinking non-stop and is
quite obviously hung over.
Versi, the Oracle
Versi has decided to defy her father and help the heroes
on their quest. She has witnessed dark futures in her
visions, and she will do anything to prevent these
coming true. She also wishes to continue doting on her
beautiful pet mortals-her 'Chosen Ones.'
Epic Paths: Versi's Vision


Epic Paths: The Wisdom of Vallus
Vallus has special advice to offer both the Gifted One and
the Lost One before they set sail in the Ultros. Refer to
the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

The Antikythera

Kyrah, Goddess of Music
Kyrah expresses her desire to continue traveling with
the heroes, in order to record their epic journey for
posterity. She will be gently amused if the heroes hadn't
realized her identity before this point.

Versi is particularly possessive of the Vanished One and
cannot bear the thought of being parted from them. She
has also had a vision concerning the location of a dragon
egg that the Vanished One might claim. Refer to the
Running the Epic Paths section for details.

Loreus, the Satyr
Loreus will step forward if the heroes previously met
him at the Mossy Temple. He has been following the
heroes' exploits and wants to be a part of their quest.
He will present one hero (the one that he loves) with a
garland of white flowers, and pledge himself to him or
her with an oath of protection.
The Ghost of Estor
The ghost of Estor Arkelander still haunts the ship at
night. Once the journey is underway, he may appear
from time to time to offer bitter advice to the heroes.
Epic Paths: Estor's Bargain
If the Lost One is aboard the ship, Estor will eventually reveal the location of the lost treasure of the
Dragonlords. Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section
for details.

Additional Crew
The heroes may have befriended the minotaur, Bullbug,
or made a deal with Moxena, the Lady of Coins. If so,
then they will be ready to join as crew members.
Roleplaying the Crew
The NPC crew of the Ultros are not additional party
members. They generally remain on the ship. Between
islands, the NPCs provide roleplaying opportunities
and information. They can teach about the history of
Thylea, or describe the constellations associated with
each island.
For certain adventures, it might make sense to have an
NPC tag along. For example, Moxena wishes to accompany the heroes on to the island of Themis. If the heroes
are wiped out in a combat encounter, several NPCs might
band together and rescue them.

The Dragon Egg
Before the heroes set sail Vallus speaks privately with
Kyrah, her sister. She gives Kyrah a locked bronze casket,
carved with protective magical runes.
The contents of this casket should remain secret until
Kyrah decides the heroes need to be told. It contains a
single dragon egg-the last of the eggs that Sydon gave
to Acastus. Vallus has entrusted this last dragon egg to
her sister, hoping to keep it out of the hands of any who
would use the egg for evil purposes.

Time is Running Out
Finally, Vallus warns the heroes that the Oath of Peace
is truly coming to an end. The five-hundred year-old
oath will remain in effect for another sixty days, but no
longer. After that, the Titans will be free to wage war
upon the mortals of Thylea once more. It's impossible
to say what will happen after that, so the heroes must
make haste:
Ch apter 4 - Voyage of the Ultros



"You have but two short months before the Oath of
Peace comes to an end: sixty days to confront Sydon in
his tower at Praxys, and Lutheria on her throne in the
Nether Sea. If you cannot renew the Oath of Peace in
that time, then I fear to think of what will befall this
city. The armies of the Titans will slaughter the people
of Mytros and soak the land in blood."
"The Titans are weaker now than they were in the
First War. You would be wise to gather what power
you can on your journey. With the right weapons and
knowledge, perhaps you could even challenge the
Titans directly, and destroy them for good."

CE)

100 intrepid sailors
One hundred brave Mytrosians and Estorians (CG
pirates), fiercely loyal men and women, have volunteered to join the heroes. They may not be demi-gods,
or even great warriors-but they are honest and true.
Fifty of them at least will be needed to row the ship.

126







You will need to keep track of how much time passes
during the voyage of the Ultros. Traveling between
islands usually takes 3 days, and the players may spend
any number of days on each island.
When the 60 days have passed, the Oath of Peace will
end, and the Titans will make their move. At that point,
refer to the Battle of Mytros chapter to determine what
happens next.

Departing Mytros
Once the heroes have finished making their preparations, they can board the ship and set sail into the
Cerulean Gulf.
The First Constellation
From the mainland, the Antikythera can be used to
navigate to any of the islands in the Cerulean Gulf. The
heroes should choose one of the first 9 constellations
and calibrate the Anitkythera for their destination.
It's not immediately clear which constellations
lead to which islands, so it may require the heroes to
guess. However, there are a few well-known islands
that the sailors are familiar with and can identify the
constellation that is associated with it. Some player
backgrounds are also familiar with certain islands
and should be able to identify the constellation that
is associated with that island. Refer to the Table of
Constellations for details.

As you raise the sail of the Ultros and begin to leave the
harbor of Mytros, you are saluted by a roar of excited
cheers from the gathered crowd. From the docks,
admirers attempt to throw flowers and small trinkets
onto the deck of your ship, all tokens of good luck.
As you sail past the Colossus of Pythor and onward
towards the horizon, a gentle breeze carries the sound
of music from the city as songs of great deeds are sung
and heartfelt prayers for the Heroes of the Prophecy
are chanted. Your voyage has begun.

Hail to the Oracle's Chosen Ones!
As the keeper of the Dragon Shrine, I have a favor
to ask of you. Many believe that all the dragons of
Balmytria's brood were killed alongside her in the First
War, five hundred years ago. However, my research
indicates that the other four dragons may have been
captured by the Titans. If this is true, then they must be
found and rescued.
I beg you to be watchful on your journey. As the
Oracle's chosen few, I believe that these dragons would
serve you, so long as you hold to the ideals of their former
masters. May the Fates guide you,



The Letter from Estoria
Aesop, the keeper of the Dragon Shrine (E7), has sent a
siren messenger from Estoria. Within the first week of
the party's departure, a siren lands on the deck of the
Ultros and delivers a letter which reads:

Navigating the Oceans
The Cerulean Gulf and the Forgotten Sea are the
domains of Sydon, Lord of Storms. He churns the
oceans with his magic, making the waters treacherous
for mortal sailors. Magical means are required to navigate these vast bodies of water.
Powerful ocean currents prevent ships from
approaching the islands without knowing their exact
whereabouts. This is why most merchant ships remain
close to the coast. The only way to successfully navigate
the oceans is to use the magical compass that Vallus
gave to the party: the Antikythera.

The Antikythera
This enchanted machine is a complex construct that
serves as a magical compass. It attunes itself to the constellations in the night sky in order to provide accurate
directions to the islands scattered around Thylea.
Choosing Destinations. The Antikythera must be
used on dry land to determine a destination, as the
constant movement of the ocean makes it impossible to
calibrate the device properly. Every island is associated
with a specific constellation. When the Antikythera is
calibrated to the proper constellation, it will show the
precise path that can be used to reach the island associated with that constellation.
Missing Gearwheel
There is a gear missing from the Antikythera that can
be found in the Great Library (Y17) on the Island of
Yonder. When this gear has been returned to the device,
the islands in the Forgotten Sea will become available.

Travel Times and Encounters
The winds and waters of Thylea are strange and unpredictable. Once the party chooses a destination with the
Antikythera, it takes 3 days of sailing to get there. The
standard travel time between any two islands is always
3 days, no matter how close they appear on the map.
Returning to the mainland also requires 3 days.
Faster Travel
Travel times can be shortened by one day through by
using a control weather spell, or by sacrificing 100 gp
worth of livestock to Sydon to ensure strong, favorable
winds. Gust of wind can also be used for this purpose,
but the caster must maintain the spell for an entire day
and this causes one level of exhaustion. Travel times
cannot be reduced to less than 2 days.
Fifty Oarsmen
The Ultros requires at least fifty oarsmen to move at its
normal pace. If the crew roster of the ship falls below
fifty oarsmen, then the travel time between landmasses
is increased by one day.
Sea Encounters
Each time the party sets sail for a new island, roll on the
random sea encounter table in the Encounters appendix. Once an encounter has been resolved, the heroes
should have smooth sailing until they arrive at the next
island. Sea encounters should not be repeated.

The Constellations
There are seventeen major constellations that are visible
on most clear nights in Thylea. Each of these constellations serves as a guide to one of the islands in the
Cerulean Gulf and the Forgotten Sea.



Stories of the Stars
Every island has narration text that describes its associated constellation. Whenever the heroes choose one of
the constellations with the Antikythera, Kyrah delivers
the appropriate narration. If Kyrah is not present, then
the narration should come from another character who
is familiar with Thylean lore.

Gears of the Antikythera
Each of the constellations has an associated numeral on
the Antikythera. To navigate using a constellation, one of
the heroes must calibrate the device and align its gears
to the appropriate numeral.

Table of Constellations
Use the table on the following page to determine which
constellations are associated with each island.

"See the Great Bear? She is always there in the sky,
hunting to feed her cubs. Unlike the other stars, she
never touches the ocean.
"At the dawn of time, the Titans created many
birds and beasts to live in the lands of Thylea but all
the waters of the oceans remained empty. Only the
Great Bear swam in the rivers and lakes. The Mother
Goddess came to her and said, 'Great Bear, you are
the wisest of the land-walkers, so I will grant you a
boon. I will fill the oceans with creatures, strange
and colorful, and you will have dominion over them.
Would this please you?'
"The Great Bear was quiet for some time until the
Goddess prompted her to speak. Finally, the Bear said,
'Mother Goddess, I am humbled by your generosity.
The creatures you speak of sound marvelous, but I
love the lands and rivers and lakes too much to leave
them for the seas.'
"The Mother Goddess understood. She smiled, and
with a wave of her hands, all the rivers and lakes of
Thylea were filled with glittering fish, so that the Great
Bear would never want for food. To this day, she loves
to swim the rivers, catching fish. But she has never
touched the ocean."

"In the stars to the east you can see the figure of a sixarmed, one-eyed giant: the Gygan.
"When the Dragonlords first arrived, there was much
strife between the newcomers and the native races
of Thylea. Blood was spilled, but none reveled in the
slaughter of warfare as much as Estor Arkelander, who
was the general of the Dragonlord armies. In one brutal
battle, he wiped out every gygan warrior to the last.
"After the massacre, the children of the gygans
prayed to Sydon and Lutheria for protection. Moved
by their plight, the great Titans rallied the centaurs,
the nymphs, all the native races. They attacked the
settlements of the Dragonlords across the islands in
retaliation for Estor Arkelander's crimes. The First War
had begun."

"Chalcia, the Goddess of Swiftness, was the only
god to escape when her siblings, Sydon and Lutheria,
decided to destroy their brothers and sisters. She
escaped to an island of fire, pursued by Sydon's storm
of wrath. She hid deep in the island and waited for
the storm to abate. You can see her cowering in those
seven bright stars.
"But Sydon and Lutheria did not leave. Instead, the
Twins reached deep into the roots of the island, shifting rock and stone to trap their sister in a tiny chamber
at the island's fiery heart. Look! You can see the red
star beneath Chalcia. It represents the everlasting torment she suffers, trapped at the island's center."

"The brightest star in the night sky is called the Golden
Heart. You can see it high above us on any clear night.
It represents the tree that sprang up when Thylea, the
Great Mother, sacrificed herself to create our land. If
you look closely, you can see a cluster of fainter stars
scattered around the Golden Heart; these represent all
the islands that sprung up from her roots.
"And if you look slightly to the west, you'll notice a
single red star watching over the Golden Heart and the
islands: Kentimane, Thylea's husband, who honors his
vow to protect his lover with an endless vigil."



IV. Constellation of
The Trickster
This constellation leads to the Island of the Chimera in
the Cerulean Gulf.




"See those stars that are shaped like a flower? That's
the constellation of the Trickster. There once was
a nobleman who took great pride in the vast rose
gardens that bloomed on his estate. Eventually, these
roses attracted the attention of the great trickster
goddess, whose name has been forgotten.
"The goddess admired the nobleman's beautiful
flowers, but she mocked his boasts: it was his servants
who deserved the credit, for they tended his gardens.
So the nobleman made the goddess a wager-if he
could grow a field of red roses without the aid of his
servants, then she must agree to marry him.
"She agreed, and for a year the nobleman tended
a plot in his garden with his own two hands: planting
the seeds, cultivating the soil, watering and weeding
every day. It was humbling, back-breaking work for the
vain nobleman, but the seeds eventually took root and
grew. But when the bushes finally flowered, the petals
were not red, but white-the goddess had switched
the seeds to teach the braggart a lesson!"




"During the First War, Pellenia, a famous bard, was captured by Lutheria, the Goddess of Dreams and Death.
Terrified as to her fate, Pellenia sang songs of dark
humor that made light of the First War's atrocities,
won Lutheria over, and so won her freedom.
"But as she departed, Pellenia grew overbold and
tried to steal Lutheria's treasures. She was captured
again and taken to the Island of Oathbreakers. There,
Lutheria made her an offer: if Pellenia could make her
laugh with one last song, then all would be forgiven.
Before Pellenia could take up her lute, Lutheria reached
out with her claws and ripped out the bard's tongue,
forever silencing her beautiful voice.
"The five stars in the constellation of the Bard
remind us of Pellenia's tale. The two brightest are the
singer herself; the next two symbolize her lute; the
small, flickering star between them all is her severed
tongue."

VI. Constellation of The Warrior
This constellation leads to the Island of the Exiles in
the Cerulean Gulf.




"You see that cluster of stars to the south? That's the
Warrior, which the people of Mytros call 'Pythor, the
God of Conquest.' In this case, his conquests came in
the bedroom rather than the battlefield. One night, he
is said to have entertained five beautiful sisters, one
after the other-and then all of them at once!
"Tales of this legendary deed reached the ears of the
green dragon Hexia, a former lover that Pythor had
abandoned. Fueled by her jealousy, Hexia captured the
sisters, turned them to stone, and placed the statues
on her island as a warning of what would happen to
any of Pythor's future conquests.
"Each of the stars is one of the sisters, a reminder
of Hexia's jealousy. Even so, Pythor still seeks out new
romantic conquests. Perhaps he seeks to add new stars
to his constellation."

"A centaur came across a scorpion stuck in a puddle
of mud. The scorpion begged for help, but the centaur
was afraid of getting stung, and so he trotted away and
left her to die.
"A gust of wind blew a branch into the puddle, and
the scorpion was able to scramble along it and escape.
She then followed the centaur's hoof prints, seeking
revenge on the selfish beast that had refused to help
her. She found the centaur sleeping in a shady glen and
stung him in the throat.
"As the lethal venom coursed through his veins, the
centaur thrashed about until one of his hooves landed
on the scorpion, crushing her. 'If you hadn't sought
revenge, we'd both be alive!' the centaur lamented with
his dying breath. 'If you had helped me, I wouldn't have

"If you use your imagination, you can see how
the stars of Titan's Folly resemble an ant. This is a
reminder of the punishment of Talieus, first-born
child of Thylea and Kentimane. Talieus was the God
of Crafting, vain and prideful. In the end, hubris-
overwhelming pride-was his downfall. He created
something which has been lost to time, something
that cannot be named.
"For this terrible crime, Kentimane stripped his
eldest son of all his power and gave it to his brother
Sydon, while Talieus himself was enslaved by his
sister Lutheria. She severed his arms, blinded him,
and sewed his lips shut. She forced him to pull her
throne across the endless waters of the Nether Sea,
with a great chain wrapped around his neck. He toiled
endlessly, blindly, for the benefit of his queen, just like
an ant..."



"That circle of stars? It's the constellation of the
Queen, Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn. Some say
those stars form a crown, signifying her status as
Queen of the Five Gods. Others believe the stars
represent the walls of a fortress, or the outline of a
shield, for Mytros protects us from the ravages of the
Titans.
"It was said she first appeared to the original settlers
in their hour of need as a pale woman with kind eyes
and silver hair. Soft-spoken, kind-hearted, she fought
valiantly to protect them during the founding of the
great city that proudly bears her name. She heralded
the dawn of civilization on these shores, and that is
why she is the Goddess of Dawn.
"But it has been many centuries since anyone other
than her priests have seen her. Though she is silent, she
has not abandoned us. She watches over us still, and
that is what the stars truly signify: not a crown, or a
shield, but the eternal vigil of the silent goddess."

"The two stars directly above us are the Twins, named
for Sydon and Lutheria. One day, the Great Tree (from
which all Thylea was born) blossomed with seven shimmering fruits. Seeing this luscious bounty, Kentimane
reached from the ocean and devoured the fruit, casting
the spike-covered pits aside.
"The pits floated on the water, taunting Kentimane.
In his anger, he smashed them to the bottom of the
sea, pricking his hands on the thorns and leaving a
wash of blood in the waves. The next morning the
seven pits floated back to the surface and split open,
and the Titans, the children of Kentimane and Thylea,
burst forth, fully formed.
"But one of the seven pits gave birth to a pair
of Titans, Sydon and Lutheria. The youngest of
Kentimane's children, they would eventually overthrow
their siblings and conquer all of Thylea in their lust for
power."

XI. Constellation of The Dragon
This constellation leads to the Island of the Dragon in
the Forgotten Sea.




"The greatest constellation in the night sky is the group
of bright stars called the Dragon.
"In the beginning, this land was populated only by
the fey creatures: nymphs, centaurs, gygans, and satyrs.
The first of the civilized races to arrive on Thylea's
shores were refugees and castaways, survivors of ships
buffeted by the storms and whirlpools that protect
these islands. They carved out a meager existence,
living in tiny villages on the coast while the children of
the Titans dominated the rest of the realm.
"But then everything changed. The Dragonlords,
astride their legendary winged mounts, discovered this
land. With the power of the dragons, the native races
were pushed back into the forests and steppes, and
Thylea was claimed for the mortal settlers.
"The constellation of the Dragon is a tribute to the
victories of the Dragonlords, and a reminder that we
are living in Thylea's Golden Age."

XII. Constellation of The Nymph
This constellation leads to the Aerie of the Roc in the

"See those stars that look like a tree? That's the
Nymph, and her story is tragic. While out on a hunt,
King Lacanus of Pythoria stumbled upon a small grove
with a single silver tree growing in the center. There he
found the most beautiful creature he had ever seen-a
dryad with silver eyes. He instantly fell in love.
"The dryad was smitten with Lacanus as well, and
she agreed to marry him, even though it meant leaving
her birth tree behind. But on the long journey to his
palace, she grew feverish and ill. Within a week, she
withered and died.
"Heartbroken, Lacanus ordered his soldiers to chop
down the silver tree so it could be used to build a
suitable coffin. As the first axe struck its trunk, Lacanus
screamed out in pain and fell dead. By marrying the
dryad, he had bound his spirit to her birth tree-and so
by felling the tree, he joined his wife in death."

"In the western sky at dusk you can see the Spear of
Sydon. It reminds me of the tale of Galimus, a soldier
who broke his oath to serve the King of Estoria.
"Galimus was a lazy, brutish coward who preyed
upon the weak. Recognizing this, his officers banished
him from the army. Bitter and resentful, Galimus
prayed to Sydon. If the Lord of Storms would transform
him into the greatest warrior in Thylea, then he would
kill the very king that he had vowed to serve.
"In answer to his prayer, Galimus was transformed
into a powerful minotaur. Reckless with power, he
rampaged throughout the king's palace, trampling and
killing all who crossed his path. Eventually the king
rallied his men against the monster. They stabbed him
a thousand times with their spears until he lay dead.
"Because of Galimus, the people of Estoria and
Mytros regard minotaurs as untrustworthy brutes, even
to this day-but Galimus was a monster long before he
became a minotaur."

"Look at those stars, scattered across the zenith of

"There was once a young priest who travelled all
the lands of Thylea, seeking out tomes and texts to
bring back to the great library in the Temple of the
Five in the city of Mytros. He spent decades on his
quest until, on one of his journeys, he met a beautiful
sorceress.
"The sorceress made him an offer: marry her, and
she would use her power to summon every book ever
written onto the shelves of his library. The young man
refused her. The journey to obtain knowledge, he said,
was just as important as the knowledge itself.
"The sorceress revealed herself as Vallus. She placed
her hands upon the priest's eyes, and forever afterwards, he could read books in every language-even
those long forgotten. This was a most beautiful gift
from the goddess to her most loyal servant."

the other stars one by one, in preparation for the Great
Feast at the end of time.
"There have always been two kinds of sailors in
Thylea. Some who grow old and wise, and some who
sail toward the Dreamer. I would not advise going that
way, unless we have no other choice."

"Look! The Blacksmith. It represents Volkan, the God
of the Forge. See how the constellation is shaped like a
hammer? There's a legend that tells of an old blacksmith
who, in his prime, had been the master of his craft. In all
his long years, he never found a worthy apprentice and,
fearing all his knowledge and expertise would be lost,
he prayed to Volkan for help.
"The God of the Forge took pity on the old man,
and in his own forge he created a golem, a lifeless
figure of iron that would follow the old smith's every
command perfectly. Volkan then transferred the spirit
of the smith into the empty golem, and whisked it
away to his secret workshop beneath the mountains
of Thylea.
"They say the old smith works there still, whistling
and hammering away, joyfully crafting tributes to the
Forge God, his skills untarnished by time."

Hergeron, and his unfortunate fate. Once the Lord
of Battle, Hergeron challenged Sydon, the Lord of
Storms, to a duel. Sydon had stolen his power from
their eldest brother Talieus, and Hergeron sought
revenge.
"But though Hergeron was unmatched in strength
and valor, he had no mind for strategy. He greatly
underestimated his younger sibling's newfound
strength, and Sydon dealt him a crushing defeat.
"As punishment for his failure, Hergeron was cast
down and imprisoned in the foundations of Sydon's
newly-erected stronghold-the Tower of Praxys.
Hergeron carries the full weight of the tower on
his shoulders, and he will continue to do so for all
eternity."

The Cerulean Gulf
"The beauty of Thylea is easy to appreciate
from the vantage of a ship deck. Speckled white
shores and crystal clear water as far as the eye can
see... it's almost enough to make this bitter old sailor
nostalgic for his glory days."

T

-Estor Arkelander, Dragonlord captain

he Cerulean Gulf is home to ten major
islands that the heroes may explore. Only one
of these islands has a critical objective that
is necessary to advance the plot: the missing
gear to the Antikythera. The other islands offer chances
for additional treasure and the opportunity to complete
various heroic tasks for the party's epic paths.

Running the Adventure
The party should probably spend a maximum of about
one month exploring the Cerulean Gulf, remembering
that it takes 2-3 days to sail between islands.
Before the heroes can sail into the Forgotten Sea,
they will need to recover the missing gear from the
Antikythera. The missing gear is in the possession of
Chondrus on the Island of Yonder (Y17).

Encounters Between Islands
Don't forget to make things interesting in the time
between the islands. Refer to the Sea Encounters section
of the appendix for ideas. Try to balance the party's time
between roleplaying and combat.
You should also run the Lord of Storms and the
Corruption of Lutheria events at some point during this
part of the adventure. Refer to Playing the Villains in the
Introduction chapter for details.

Making Landfall
When the heroes arrive at an island, they can put down
anchor-or beach their ship at a safe spot on shore.
Some islands don't have anywhere to beach a ship, while
other islands don't have suitable anchorages. If the text
doesn't specify either, then you may allow your players
to leave the ship wherever you feel is appropriate.

Island Handouts
Illustrated maps are provided for many of the islands in
this region. These maps are intended to be handed out
to players when they reach the islands. The maps give a
sense of the geography of the island-they don't reveal
any information that needs to be kept hidden.

The Golden Heart
Easy Hunting

Read the following as the heroes approach the island:




Your ship glides through the shallow waters of this paradise and you make landfall on its pristine white beach
without incident. The forests that stand before you are
crowded with immense oak trees. There is a noticeable lack of anything man made in sight. A small herd
of deer, curious and unafraid, make their way towards
your vessel from the forest's edge.


Hunting the Golden Beasts
Anyone using the Wisdom (Survival) skill to hunt for food
has advantage on such checks. If the heroes decide that
they want to hunt some of the divine creatures on the
island, they may use their Survival skill to track them.
Survival rolls of 15+ reveal the tracks of a great boar.
Rolls of 20+ reveal the tracks of a golden lion and his
pride. Rolls of 25+ reveal the tracks of the golden ram.
Tracking one of these animals requires 1d4+1 hours, at
which point the tracker establishes line of sight.



This island has been legendary for as long as there have
been settlers in Thylea. Some of the Dragonlords landed
on this island and came back with stories of animals
that were almost divine in stature. These creatures were
more beautiful and noble than any others of their kind.
That didn't stop the Dragonlords from hunting them:
one golden lion was caught and killed, and its hide was
used to make a fabulous magical cloak.
While such magnificent beasts have been found
on Thylea's mainland, they have never been seen in
the numbers that are reputed to be on this island. For
centuries, sailors have sought out the island in hopes of
taking the hide of a divine beast and selling it for a king's
ransom in Mytros.

Garden of the Mother Goddess




This island has unparalleled natural beauty. It appears
to be covered in dense forest, most of which are
ancient oak and fir trees that loom to great heights.
The dense forest is broken occasionally by clearings
covered in tall, golden grass. At the very center of the
island stands an enormous oak tree that towers more
than two hundred feet into the air.


The tree at the center of the island is the Heart of
Thylea. It is here that mortals and gods can speak with
the Mother Goddess, Thylea herself.
If someone is foolish enough to damage the tree, then
two Hands of Kentimane will erupt from the earth and
attack them. If the hands are defeated, then Kentimane
himself will appear and annihilate all trespassers.
Communing with Thylea. To commune with Thylea,
someone must place their hand on the bark of the tree.
If the goddess feels that the person is worthy, she will
answer a single question. This works the same way as
the divination spell.

138

Animals of all kinds are abundant on the island: tropical birds; large mammals such as deer, boar, sheep; and
smaller creatures such as rabbits, beavers, possums and
raccoons. Hunting is easy since none of the animals on
the island have learned to fear humans or humanoids.

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

Eternal Apples
The fruit trees on the island bear delicious apples that
remain eternally fresh until eaten. Eating one of these
apples has the same effect as a potion of healing.
If several barrels of apples are taken from the island,
all but one barrel (containing 20 apples) will immediately ferment into cider. While delicious, the cider has
no special healing effects.

Blessed Olive Oil
The olive trees here have been blessed by the Mother
Goddess. The olives may be harvested and pressed into
blessed olive oil. This process requires three heroes to
perform a full day of work on the island.

Encounter: The Pegasus






Somewhere in the sky above, you hear a horse's
whinny. Glancing upward, you see a white-winged
creature gliding through the clouds. A flying horse-of
all things-gracefully alights on a tall rock and watches
you cautiously from a distance. You've heard stories of
this creature. It's called a pegasus.




This pegasus is proud and pure of heart. It can only be
approached by good-aligned heroes. If anyone of an evil
alignment approaches the pegasus, it snorts contemptuously and flies away. Even a good-aligned character may
provoke this reaction if they have ever performed an evil
deed. In such a case, the character experiences a vision,
a demanding memory of their past evil deed, just as the
pegasus flies away.

If one hero proves worthy enough to approach the
pegasus, then it may be bonded to that hero with a
pegasus bridle. Such a bridle may be crafted at the
Mithral Forge. Once tamed, the pegasus will join the
heroes on the Ultros. Its favorite food is the perpetually
fresh eternal apples that can be collected on this island.

This chase serves the purpose of bringing the heroes
to the point where they can commune with Thylea, the
Mother Goddess. The golden ram knows that all worthy
heroes should be brought to this place.

Event: Hunted by Lions

Event: The Golden Ram
If the heroes explore the jungle, they will find no signs
of civilization. Within one hour of landfall, they will
encounter their first sign of one of the golden beasts-
the golden ram.
The ram runs from the party using its full movement
speed, making its way to the center of the island. It
climbs the hill where the great oak tree of Thylea stands.
Once it gets to the top, it uses its ability to fly to easily
outdistance pursuers and hide in the forest.

Within six hours of the heroes making landfall, a pride
of eight female lions led by a golden lion will begin to
hunt them. At first, the heroes will only hear the roar of
lions in the distance. Within a few minutes, anyone with
a passive Perception score of 15 or higher will notice
that they are being hunted.
The lions are good hunters, and they will wait to
pounce until the heroes are in a vulnerable position. For
example, they might attack just before the party gets
back to the Ultros. The lions have advantage on all of
their Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Island of the Chimera




Your ship approaches a curved island that wraps
around a wide blue lagoon. A small, craggy mountain
marks the island's high point. Despite the lagoon's
calm waters, a number of abandoned ships dot the
shore. Most are intact, but some have obviously
begun to succumb to age and rot. No other signs of
civilization can be seen within the natural harbor of
the lagoon, only the hulks.
Suddenly, a winged monstrosity appears above the
island, flying in the direction of your ship. The creature
appears to have three ferocious-looking heads, each of
which is entirely different from the others.


that is now legendary among sailors. King Acastus has
offered a 1,000 gp bounty for the beast's death.

Event: Attack of the Chimera



This island is the crater rim of an extinct volcano. It is
shaped like a crescent moon, and the interior lagoon has
beautiful, calm turquoise water. Anchor can be dropped
anywhere in the lagoon, and the ship can also be run
ashore on many of the beaches.
An unusually aggressive chimera (maximum HP) lives
on this island. It has preyed upon Thylean merchant
ships for nearly five decades, and has a treasure trove

When the heroes approach the island, the chimera will
fly down to attack. It will remain at a distance and use its
breath weapon. As soon as it is reduced to half of its hit
points, it will retreat, using its full move and taking the
Dodge action. It will return to its lair to lick its wounds
and return to full health.
The small island is a crescent with a small mountain
marking the center of the curved ridgeline. Near the top
of the mountain is the chimera's cave lair. The cave is
filled with hundreds of bones, all that remains of sailors
that the monstrosity has taken over the years. The chimera will fight to the death in its lair.
Treasure
At the back of the cave is a pile of rotting crates, chests
and small boats mingled with thousands of copper, silver
and gold pieces. In total there are 11,000 cp, 7,600 sp
and 2,300 gp. There are 25 gems worth 100 gp each,
3 gem-studded necklaces worth 500 gp each, and 7 platinum rings worth 150 gp each.

Many stories are told of the islands in the Cerulean Gulf. Although the Forgotten Sea is more distant and
dangerous, the Gulf is often crossed by mortal sailors traveling between Mytros and Aresia. Shipwrecks are
common, as are sightings of mythical beasts, forgotten gods, and even dragons. Many of those who travel
into the heart of the sea are never seen again, and for this reason, mortal sailors customarily hug the
coastlines in their ships.

Island of the Fates




The island before you is a bleak, rocky place. Wind
and rain batter your ship and the shore alike. Sparse
vegetation interrupts the monotony of the gray stone,
sea and overcast sky. Rocky cliffs surround almost the
entire coastline of the island, but there is a small bay
where landfall might be possible. Apart from the occasional call of a sea bird, the tumultuous waves are the
only sounds that reverberate through the area.


frogs, and toads live in the murky pools, while sea gulls
cry out ceaselessly from the cliffs.
A coven of hags make their lair in the cave system
at the center of the island. These hags are in fact the
ancient beings known throughout Thylea as the Fates.

KEY LOCATIONS
1. The Fetid Pond



This island is surrounded by rocky cliffs, which are
pitted by constant rain and wind. There is only one
small bay where a ship can make anchor.
The island is bleak. It features little more than rocks
and shallow ponds. The skies are always overcast, and
rainfall is almost constant. Plant life consists mostly of
moss and some stunted, twisted trees. Small lizards,

140

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf



At the center of the island is a pit with a narrow path
that winds down to the bottom. At the very bottom
of the pit is a fetid, shallow pond. Humanoid skeletons
reach out from the pond in several places. Around
the edge of the pond is a single large cave entrance,
flanked by three smaller tunnels.




The largest cave leads to the Lair of the Hags. This
entrance is guarded by a lamia who was once an
Amazon warrior. She bargained with the Fates long ago,
but she failed to fulfill her contract. As punishment, they
transformed her into a monster. She greets the heroes
stoically and guides them to the hags.
The Fates protect themselves through the services of
cursed mortals who have broken their contracts with the
coven. In addition to the lamia, the caves are watched
by two other monsters. All three of these servants are
vigilant and protect the Fates with their lives.

• A medusa, once a beautiful nymph named Irisa.
• A shambling mound, once an elven explorer.
The Hideous Fates
The Fates have lived on this island for millennia, and
they have always been willing to make dark deals with
those willing to pay their price. They have bargained
with great beings such as Sydon and Lutheria, but they
have also made deals with lesser powers such as nymphs
and even mortal heroes.
The coven is led by a night hag named Granny Morta.
The other two members of the coven are Morta's revolting daughters, Nona and Decima.

• Granny Morta (NE night hag) is doting and ribald.

She cheerfully snips at the hags' loom with a pair of
rusty scissors as she speaks, cackling frequently.
• Nona (CE green hag) is resentful and angry. She
drools as she watches visitors, clearly imagining how
they would taste between her wicked teeth.
• Decima (LE green hag) is dutiful and bashful. She
attends to her mother faithfully, and she flirts with the
heroes as she attends to the hags' loom.
Epic Paths: Consulting the Fates
Several of the Epic Paths need to consult with the Fates
in order to learn more about the events that forever
changed their lives: the Doomed One, the Haunted One,
and the Dragonslayer. The Doomed One also needs to
use the hags' loom to craft their greater artifact. Refer to
the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

2. Lair of the Hags




This expansive cave smells strongly of rotten eggs. A
large pit in the center of the cave is filled with bubbling
yellow ichor. Swimming around in the ichor are dozens
of worm-like larvae with mortal faces. Scattered
around the cave are heaps of filthy linens.
In the far corner of the room, three hideous women
stand around an imposing loom which seems to have
been carved from the bones of a gigantic creature.




The hags are almost always found here, working on
the loom or cackling to each other about the gruesome
deaths of past heroes. They might also be carving up
a squealing larva and eating it alive. The hags are not
hostile: they will instead wait to see if the heroes have
come to negotiate for some boon or magical item. If the
heroes are hostile toward the hags, then the coven will
use their full power to destroy the intruders.
Horrifying Larvae. These hideous creatures are
worms the size of dogs and have the faces of humans,
elves, dwarves, and other mortals. They are evil souls
who have been "rewarded" for their past deeds. They
will be used as food for fiends-or as spell components
in the hags' dark rituals.
Loom of the Fates. The loom was crafted from the
bones of a metallic dragon. This is the hag's loom, a
powerful magical item. The loom currently supports a
beautiful tapestry that is being woven by the hags. The
tapestry's image shows everything that has happened
to the heroes over the course of the last week, including
their arrival at the hags' cave.
The Hag Coven
The coven has a shared pool of spells. Refer to the Hag
Covens side bar in the 5th Edition bestiary book.
The medusa, Irisa, possesses the coven's hag eye. The
night hag, Morta, has a heartstone and a soul bag, both of
which she keeps on her person at all times. For information on the hag eye, heartstone and soul bag refer to the
Hags section in the 5th Edition bestiary book.
Granny Morta is an ancient hag who claims to have
lived for more than ten thousand years. She has maximum hit points (165) and a special lair action. She can
take her lair action on initiative count 20. One creature
that she can see must succeed at a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or be banished to the plane of Hades. As
long as Morta concentrates on the banishment, the creature remains trapped in Hades. If she decides to use the
lair action again, or her concentration is disrupted, the
creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
unoccupied space.
If Morta manages to concentrate on a creature's
banishment for 10 consecutive rounds, then the target
is permanently banished to Hades. However, while
in Hades the creature can make a successful DC 20
Wisdom (Survival) check to find the path that the hag
coven uses to travel between the mortal realm and the
plane of Hades.

Dragon's Egg
The hags' most valuable item is a copper dragon egg.
Lutheria gave the egg to them so that it could be corrupted and then delivered to Sydon. The hag coven
has been responsible for corrupting all of the metallic
dragon eggs that have come into possession of Sydon
Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

The Fates are wicked creatures, in spite of their hallowed place
and Lutheria. Even with the magic that the hags use
on the eggs, the dragons are not born evil, but they are
made susceptible to evil's influence.

among the Great Powers of Thylea. They play with mortal lives
as if they were toys, and their hearts are rotten to the core.
Truly, not even the Titans trust them.

Treasure
The hags have a strange collection of jewelry, artwork,
and magic items. This collection includes:

• A strange necklace made from the teeth of yugoloth

that have been dipped in gold. It is worth 2,000 gp to
the right buyer.
• A silver wyrmling's skull that has been coated in platinum. The eye sockets have sapphires. It is worth 5,000
gp to the right buyer.
• Two potions of greater healing.
Bargaining with the Fates
The heroes can negotiate a deal with the hag coven if they
wish. The hags will assume that is the reason why the
heroes have come to their island and won't attack until
they know better. The heroes can ask for something specific, or the hags can suggest some of the options listed
below. Only one hero needs to make a deal with the hags.
Boons of the Fates
These are the services that the hags can provide to the
heroes in exchange for tasks:

• Divination. The hags can describe up to three islands

in the Cerulean Gulf and the Forgotten Sea in detail,
including any treasure that might interest in the heroes.
• Raise Dead. The hags can use the spell raise dead to
bring any number of corpses back to life.
• Bestow Experience. The hags can make the heroes
stronger. They narrate one of the Myths of Thylea, and
every hero immediately gains 5,000 XP.
• Loom Crafting. The hags can use their loom to craft
a magic item. They require the necessary ingredients.
The Oracle is also able to use the hag's loom to make
magic items, but the hags will not reveal this.
Tasks of the Fates
These are the tasks that the hags will demand in
exchange for their services. These tasks always come
with a time limit, and they count as evil deeds that stain
the reputation of the party when carried out.

• Kill the Oracle within two weeks.
• Bring a baby girl to the coven within one week.
• Bring a living nymph to the coven within one week.
The hags hate the Oracle and have always wished her
dead. The baby girl would be twisted and corrupted to
create a new hag. The nymph would be tortured and
devoured as a delectable snack.
Breaking the Deal. The hags will afflict those who
break the deal with the curse of the medusa. For more
information about this curse, refer to The Mortal
Curses in the Introduction chapter.

Tunnels to the Underworld
The other three tunnels that flank the main cave
entrance lead deep beneath the earth. It takes explorers
1d4 hours to traverse more than a mile down one of the
tunnels in order to discover anything.
First Tunnel. The first tunnel leads to the Underdark,
and it is beyond the scope of this adventure. The party
might encounter giant mushroom forests, dark elven
raiders, or some other strange denizen of that place.
Second Tunnel. The second tunnel breaks through
the ceiling above the Nether Sea. The sea is a half-mile
drop from the ceiling, and a fall from this height causes
70 (20d6) falling damage. The Nether Sea is deadly without a ship. Refer to the Nether Sea chapter for details.
Third Tunnel. The third and final tunnel also continues for a mile before opening onto a blasted wasteland: this is the plane of Hades. A company of a dozen
mezzoloths led by a nycaloth watch over this portal
between worlds and are currently raising two cerberus
hounds for the hag coven. The hags sometimes come
down here to check on the hounds' progress or to bargain with the yugoloths for more larvae. The yugoloth
and the cerberus hounds will attack anyone other than a
hag who emerges from the tunnel.

3. Cave of Manticores
This cave is at the highest point on the island.




High up, near the top of the mountain, you come
across a cave. Bones, animal and humanoid, litter the
ground near the cave mouth. Most are cracked or shattered into pieces, lining the path into the dark with a
sort of macabre gravel. Although the cave is cloaked in
shadow, there is a glint of light shining inside.




The cave is the den for a family of manticores. This
mated pair and their offspring have served the hags for
decades and are well fed and groomed. They are larger
than typical manticores (98 hit points each).
They have a brood of four smaller manticores. These
siblings hate each other, and only return to the cave
occasionally. You can add them to the encounter if you
wish to increase the danger and tension.
Treasure
Over the years the manticores have gathered treasure
from passing ships. Scattered amongst the bones are
1,100 sp, 650 gp, two matched platinum goblets worth
400 gp each, and a necklace of sapphires worth 1,500 gp.

4. Ruined tower




This crumbling tower is built to a scale far larger
than normal human proportions. The civilization that
built it must have been giants. The skeletal remains
of the former inhabitants are scattered throughout
the ruins. In addition to their great size, these skeletons all have skulls with a single central eye socket
and six arms.




This ruin was once a lighthouse and fort for the Gygan
Empire, and it was brought down by the Dragonlords five
centuries ago. The skeletons of six-armed cyclopes can be
found around and within the ruins of the tower itself.
Treasure
Inside the tower is a bronze chest that has been broken
open. It has obviously been looted at some point in the
past, but it still contains a number of large scroll cases.
The scrolls detail the history of the war between the
Dragonlords and the Gygan Empire. This account paints
the Dragonlords as brutal oppressors who wiped out the
Gygans without a shred of mercy.

Island of the Exiles




Although the sea is calm, finding a safe place to come
ashore on this rocky island is a difficult task. There is
one obvious place to make landfall: a stone dock on the
island's only beach. A lone figure stands upon the dock,
watching warily as your ship approaches. Vegetation
grows by the shore, but there are no trees.




1. The dock
The only safe way to gain access to the island by ship is
to use the stone dock located on the south of the island.
Idylla is watching the docks when the heroes arrive. She
sends another exile to alert the village.
Idylla immediately realizes that the Ultros is not a
prison ship from Mytros. She wants to introduce herself



"Hail, strangers, and well met. Do my eyes deceive
me or is that the Ultros? You must be great warriors
to command such a ship. Welcome to the Island of
Exiles. I am called Idylla. Perhaps you have heard of
my son-King Acastus of Mytros?"



For more than a century, this island has served as a
prison colony for exiles. There are several small fishing boats tied up at the stone dock. One of the exiles
is always on watch at the dock to alert the community
when new arrivals make landfall.
Criminals from Mytros accused of heinous crimes
(such as murder) are sometimes exiled to this island for
the rest of their lives. Mytrosian justice also allows for
powerful citizens to be exiled by popular consent. When
this happens, the exiles are ferried to the island, where
they must remain for at least a decade.
The sailing route to the island is a well-kept secret
known only to King Acastus and his closest advisors.
This is not a secret that Acastus shares with the heroes,
as too many of his personal enemies are on the rocky
island. The island has no large trees for good reason:
no trees mean no wood for boat building. The island is
mostly covered in bushes and small fig trees which are
entirely unsuitable for any nautical purposes.

to the party before her rivals in the village have a chance
to meet them. She welcomes them to the island and
does everything she can to ingratiate herself.





2. The Village
The exiles and criminals have learned to co-exist, and
have built a simple community near the center of the
island. It consists of a dozen stone houses and a plain
temple to the Five Gods. A well provides fresh water,
and several small gardens provide vegetables.
The Exiles
The inhabitants of the island are an eclectic group who
have learned to live together. Every year they vote for
a new "king." This king is a moderator for disputes. He
decides how to punish those who transgress against the
small community's rules.
There are 25 men (CE, NE and LN commoners) and
three women (NE nobles) in the community. The most
important members of the community are:

• King Stavros (LE noble). One of the newer exiles,

Stavros has been voted king for the past two years. A
charismatic man, Stavros was one of the most successful wine merchants in all of Thylea. He claims to
have been exiled by popular vote, but in reality, he was
sent to the island for poisoning a rival. Stavros is paranoid that a new prisoner or exile will reveal his lie, but
so far, no one has shown up on the island who knows
the truth about his past.

• Tadd (CE bandit). A recluse, Tadd is one of the

strangest inhabitants of the island. He has a penchant
for talking to himself, randomly screaming obscenities
at the gods, and defecating in the middle of conversations. His obvious "eccentricities" are overlooked
because he is the island's best woodworker, stone
mason, and architect. He was sent to the island for
murdering six women in Stygian Row. Idylla and the
other women of the island hate and fear him for obvious reasons.
• Keelan (CN gladiator). A skilled warrior and
thoughtful philosopher from a respected family in
Mytros, Keelan has a fiery temper. He feels that he
deserves his fate on the island as he killed his brother
in a fit of anger while arguing over a woman. Keelan
is well respected by the other exiles, but this is not
reciprocal. He detests everyone on the island, but he
is careful not to let it show. He will urge the heroes
not to free anyone from the island, because they all
deserve to be here-or much worse.
• Tyrone (CE bandit). A self-righteous and angry man,
Tyrone is perpetually plotting to escape the island.
Tyrone was a loud-mouthed demagogue in Mytros,
and his rabble-rousing ways eventually got him exiled.
Six of the younger exiles are besotted by his words,
but he has yet to be elected king, because everyone
else knows that he's a small-minded blowhard. Tyrone
will constantly badger the heroes to let him and his
followers accompany them on their voyage. If he is
rebuffed, he becomes angry, but he is too much of a
coward to do anything about it.
• Idylla (LE noble). Idylla is one of the few women
on the island. She boasts considerable influence and
excellent political instincts. Idylla was exiled from
Mytros because she is Acastus's mother, and many
citizens felt that she was abusing her influence over
the king in the early years of his reign. The nobility banded together to have her exiled. Acastus was
outwardly distraught, but secretly, he was glad to be
rid of his overbearing mother. Idylla is regarded as the
most beautiful woman on the island. Many of the men
vie for her favor, but she has been careful not to play
favorites. If Idylla senses that she can convince a hero
to take her off of the island, she will use her considerable charm to seduce them. She dotes on Acastus,
but she has no loyalty to him, and she has no qualms
betraying him if it means escaping the island.
Event: Murder Investigation
King Stavros attempts to greet the heroes as soon as
they arrive on the island. He approaches them with six
other exiles, including Idylla and Keelan. He introduces
himself and explains the nature of the island. He is
quite open about their status as exiles and "criminals" in
Mytros. He questions the heroes as to their purpose, but

144

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

he will quickly steer the conversation to the problem he
needs solved-a problem that is causing much distress
to the island's makeshift community.
Someone is murdering the other exiles. Four men
have already been killed, all with their throats neatly cut.
Idylla thinks it must be the recluse Tadd, while Stavros
suspects that Tyrone is trying to supplant him. Keelan
feels that jumping to conclusions doesn't help anything,
as the murderer could be anyone, including one of the
three of them. Stavros and Idylla want the heroes to
investigate the murders-since they've just arrived,
everyone agrees that they are neutral in the dispute.
If the heroes agree, then they will find that everyone is tight-lipped about the murders, and all four
bodies have been burned, leaving no remains. Unless
some means of talking to the spirits of the murdered
people can be found, solid evidence is difficult to find.
However, if the party can come up with a convincing
case against someone on the island, Stavros and Idylla
will be satisfied. Keelan will not be happy with any
explanation.
There are three possible explanations for the murders.
You can choose any of the following to be true:
Idylla's Theory. Idylla believes that the most likely
murderer is Tadd. He's a strange man, and he can offer
no coherent account of his whereabouts over any period
of time. He could easily kill someone and then instantly
forget that he did it. He's also a monster.
Tyrone's Fanatics. Tyrone is not the killer, but two of
his men could be responsible. He has no idea whether
they actually did it, but it would flatter him if they did.
They've assaulted people who have spoken out against
him in the past. Murder would be the natural next step,
and his detractors deserve it, in any case.
Keelan's Hatred. Keelan has the necessary skills to
kill people and cover it up. He loathes everyone on the
island, but no one suspects him of murder, because
everyone just assumes that he's as genial as his placid
exterior suggests. If accused of the murder, Keelan
might simply confess-he's just glad to finally talk about
how much he hates everyone.
Rewards
If the heroes solve the murder, then the exiles reward
the party with a white ox worth 500 gp. The ox can be
used as sacrificial livestock aboard the Ultros.
Additional Crew. If the party solves the murder, they
earn the respect of the exiles. The party may choose
to take up to 25 of them on as crew for the Ultros, to
replenish any crew who have been lost at sea.
If the party doesn't solve the murder, then the exiles
are unwilling to join their crew. The thought of being
confined on a ship with a potential murderer is more
terrifying than remaining on the island.

Scorpion Island




Bonding Scorpion Tribe Centaurs

You sail towards an island edged by sandy beaches
and calm waters. The land is largely flat, and grasslands stretch out across the island, interrupted only by
shrubs and small trees. The solitary structure visible
from your ship is an ominous black stone tower at the
island's center.


The Scorpion Tribe centaurs are the only NPC centaurs
in Thylea who allow themselves to be used as mounts.
Centaur mounts act independently in combat, making
them an exceptional addition to any party.
Centaur heroes may still bond one of the centaurs from
the Scorpion Tribe. In this case, they obviously cannot use
them as a mount-instead, the bond must be true love.



It's easy to find a place to anchor or beach a ship here.
The island is relatively flat and storms keep the foliage
sparse and low to the ground.
The Scorpion Tribe
This island is famed for the "Scorpion Tribe," a lineage
of cursed centaurs who have lived here for centuries.
The centaurs of this tribe are doomed to transform into
monstrous giant scorpions when they reach adulthood.
The only way to overcome the curse is to bond with a
mortal rider and leave the island forever.
Scorpions of every size and color live on the island,
including the giant scorpions that used to be centaurs.
The curse is the work of the Lotus Witch, a powerful gynosphinx that lives in the tower at the center of
the island. The sphinx keeps to herself. Those foolish
enough to approach her tower never return.
The centaurs here are all young and impetuous.
There are no elders to temper their youth with wisdom,
because the adults all leave the island or transform into
scorpions. The knowledge that so many are doomed by
the curse makes the centaurs wild, as they know that life
can be very short. They band together into groups of
twelve-racing, drinking, hunting, and frolicking. They
avoid the giant scorpions.

Aresian Proving Grounds
This island is also a holy place of initiation for the warriors
of Aresia. Aresians who wish to be considered true warriors make a pilgrimage to the island and test themselves
against the scorpions. This doubles as a funeral rite for the
centaurs that were transformed. It is a great honor, and a
sign of a great destiny, if a young Aresian is able to find and
bond with one of the young centaurs of the Scorpion Tribe.
There are usually a dozen young Aresians (LN warrior
monks) undergoing their trials on the island. They are
expected to work together to trap and kill one of the giant
scorpions. Three of their masters await on the shore of the
island to see who amongst them will survive their trial.
Encounter: Aresian Warriors




As you come ashore, you encounter three athletic
humans wearing scarlet red cloaks and bronze bracers.
You recognize them as Aresian warriors.




Constitution checks until one character wins.

These three warrior monks are meditating, exercising, and debating the nature of the universe. They are
annoyed to see outsiders on their sacred island. They
firmly ask that the heroes not disturb the trials of the
younger monks on the island.
If the heroes are respectful, then the monks are willing
to explain their customs and the history of the Scorpion
Tribe. They don't know much about the Lotus Witch,
except that she dwells in the tower and that she's the one
who cursed the centaurs.

The Bonding Ritual
When a band of centaurs of the Scorpion Tribe encounter visiting mortals, they may decide to initiate the
"bonding ritual." The ritual involves twelve centaurs and
the entire party engaging in the following activities:

• Drinking Contest. Everyone makes opposed

• Wrestling Contest. Everyone present makes Strength
• Storytelling Contest. Everyone present makes
• Stargazing Contest. Everyone present makes



This clearing is dominated by three giant scorpions,
each the size of a horse. Surrounding the scorpions are
six young Aresian warriors brandishing spears and clad
in brilliant red cloaks. The warriors seem badly outmatched-one of them is mortally wounded.

Use each contest as an opportunity to roleplay. Ask
the winning player how they won the contest. At the end
of the ritual festivities, the centaurs may choose one or
more heroes to bond with, based on their performance.

The six Aresians (LN warrior monks) successfully
tracked down a single giant scorpion to kill for their
trials, but unfortunately, they were immediately
ambushed by two more. Unless the party comes to their
aid within two rounds, they will all be killed, and then
the scorpions will turn on the party.
After four rounds, a band of twelve centaurs arrives
to join the fight against the scorpions. Normally, the
centaurs avoid the giant scorpions, but this band is led
by Nessa (see appendix). Nessa is seeking someone to
bond with, and she thinks it's a terrible waste to allow so
many mortal warriors be slaughtered for no reason.
Once the fighting is done, Nessa proposes a feast
under the stars with the survivors. She's willing to bond
with any hero who impresses her during the bonding
ritual. Others in her band of twelve may also choose to
bond with the heroes-use your discretion, as centaur
mounts make very powerful allies.
Pholon the Brotherly

once had a great library, a collection of knowledge
carved into the trees of the island's forest.
But the island's centaurs, who had long been charged
with protecting the forest, chopped it down for firewood. As punishment for this reckless destruction of
knowledge, the Lotus Witch cursed the centaurs-and
they became known as the Scorpion Tribe.
Approaching the Tower
There is no way to enter the tower from the air. Those
who try to enter the tower by flying will meet sudden
cross-winds, and storm clouds will appear in the sky
where there were none before.
Every round, a lightning bolt will strike any flyers for
28 (8d6) lightning damage. A successful DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw will halve this damage. The bolts will
not stop until a flyer lands or turns away and retreats
to more than 1,000 ft. from the tower. The tower is
immune to all magical spells and no teleportation magic
can access its interior.
Walking Through the Flowers
Only walking into the fields of flowers will reveal the
tower's entrance. Read the following:

If your players have not yet encountered Pholon (see
appendix), then you may choose to have them encounter him here on Scorpion Isle. You may use the event
described in the Encounters appendix. Pholon and Nessa
are old friends.



2. Tower of the Lotus Witch




As you approach the center of the island, the sun
shines down from a clear, cloudless sky. Before you, a
huge black stone obelisk reaches more than 200 feet
into the heavens. Entry into this strange tower seems
impossible, as there are no doors or windows to be
seen. Stretching between you and the tower is a field
of vibrant yellow wildflowers.


This tower is the lair of the Lotus Witch, the island's
true mistress. The sphinx is an exile from the Island
of Time. None but she know why she was exiled. She
came to this island seeking knowledge-the centaurs



As you enter the field of wildflowers, the sun zips
across the sky and sinks into the eastern horizon. The
sky darkens until it is decorated with twinkling stars.
After a few moments, the sun rises from the west and
sets again in the east. This day-night cycle repeats over
and over, until your surroundings become a blur.
Suddenly, the night sky comes back into focus and
you find yourselves before a previously unseen doorway
leading into the tower. The pathetic cries of small children and infants drifts from the entrance.






No time has actually passed for the heroes as a result of
walking through the wildflowers.
One-Way Door. The doorway into the tower is a
one-way door. No one will notice this until they decide
to leave: only then will they see that the doorway has
vanished. Anyone still outside can still see the doorway
and is able to enter freely.
Inside the Tower




This room is filled with over a dozen children. Some
are infants, barely able to toddle, while others are a
few years old. Most of them clutch yellow flowers in
their hands. Some are human and elves, while others
are minotaurs and centaurs. Piled in the corners of the
room are heaps of clothing and equipment that might
have belonged to adult versions of these children.




These children are all victims of the sphinx. They are
former adventurers, Aresian hopefuls, and centaurs
who dared enter the tower and failed the sphinx's tests.
She reduced them all to a youthful state and comes
down every few years to keep them young. Some of the
children are chronologically centuries old, but they have
lived almost all of those years as children. The children
collect the lotus flowers outside and press them into oils
to be used by the sphinx.
The most helpful child is a five-year-old boy named
Leander (NG commoner). Leander tells the heroes that
they are in danger and that they shouldn't have come.
He tells them that the Lotus Witch will be angry with
them, and that they must now go see her and then beg
for forgiveness. If asked where to find the Lotus Witch,
the boy points upwards and tell them that she is at the
top of the tower.
The Windowed Staircase
There is a spiral staircase that ascends upwards for
hundreds of feet:




The spiraling stone staircase that ascends the Lotus
Witch's tower seems to go on forever. Time within the
tower seems to take on the same strange quality you
experienced outside: some windows are flooded with
intense sunlight, while others allow in gentle beams of
moonlight. Climbing the staircase is disorienting, and it
leaves you feeling slightly nauseated.


The staircase is 200 feet in height, there are seven windows along its length. Each window looks into another
plane of existence. The windows are only a foot in
diameter, though a creature of Small size could squeeze
through with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check. Tiny creatures can crawl through the windows
with no difficulty. It is impossible to use magic to teleport through them.
Exploring the Windows. Anyone who gets to the
other side of a window will fall about 100 ft. to the
ground for 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage. If they survive, they will be free to explore whichever world they
have entered. After one hour, they will hear a lion roar,
and they will be instantly transported to the top of the
tower-standing in front of the sphinx.
The Seven Windows
• Elysium. This window looks out into the beautiful,
expansive vistas of the plane, Elysium.
• Tartarus. This window looks out into the horrifying
hellscapes of the prison plane, Tartarus.
• Astral. This window looks out into an empty expanse
of stars and nebulae-the Astral Plane.
• Hades. This window looks out into the dismal plane
of Hades. An army of thousands of insect men can be



seen marching in perfect formation across the burning wastelands of Hades. This is an army of yugoloths.
Anyone going through the window will be approached
by a detachment of six mezzoloths and a nycaloth.
• Earth. This window looks out into Earth in the
10th century BC during the battle for Troy, and the
duel between Hector and Achilles. A battle line of
Achaeans watches from one side, while the Trojans
look down from the walls of Troy. Hector and Achilles
fight for 10 rounds before Achilles prevails. If the
heroes somehow become involved, treat the two
famed warriors as gladiators (165 HP).
• Thylea. This window looks out into Thylea from
10 miles above Scorpion Island, and it is the only
window to be sealed by a glass cover (10 HP). If
the glass is broken, the difference in air pressure
between the tower's interior and 10 miles altitude
means that air begins to rush through the window.
Anyone within 10 feet of the window must make a
DC 10 Strength saving throw or be sucked into the
window; creatures of Small size (or smaller) will pass
through. Larger creatures take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning
damage as they slam against the wall around the
window. Anyone who is sucked through will fall 10
miles back to Scorpion Island for 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage.
• Another World. This window looks out into another
world. Choose any fantasy world you feel comfortable
describing to your players. For example, it might be a
famous battle from The Lord of the Rings.
The Sphinx's Lair
The sphinx's lair is at the top of the spiral staircase:




The twisting stair opens into a stone room at the top
of the tower. The floor, walls, and ceiling are covered
in etched hieroglyphics. A closer look reveals that the
markings are roughly made, as if they were scratched
into the rock with primitive tools.
A majestic winged lion with the face of a regal
woman sits in the center of the room. Behind her, a
wide window shows the island below bathed in daylight. Upon seeing you, she demands "Why have you
disturbed my contemplations?"




The Lotus Witch (TN gynosphinx) listens to the party
for a while, but eventually, she interrupts and asks the
heroes whether they are aware of the history of Thylea.
She explains that it is important to know history, or one
will be doomed to repeat history's mistakes. Those who
are oblivious to history are no better than infants-and
they should be treated as such. She wonders whether the
party deserves to be transformed into infants like the
former adventurers downstairs-her "children."
Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

149

sphinx will not fight to kill-only to incapacitate. If she
is reduced to half hit points, she will use her lair action
to shift all of the combatant heroes and herself to one of
the realms on the other side of the stairwell windows.
You can choose which one.
If the party kills the sphinx, they will be transported
back to the tower (if they are in another plane).
If the sphinx defeats the entire party, she will reduce
them all to infants and children and they will join the
other children downstairs. If you want the campaign to
continue, Pythor or another one of the gods will come to
negotiate the heroes' release and restoration.
Treasure. The sphinx has 15 assorted gems worth
500 gp each. Of more practical value are the half-dozen
spell books that the Lotus Witch has collected over
the centuries. She took these from various wizards
who invaded her tower and, together, the spell books
include 5 random spells from each level up to 6th level
(30 total).

Epic Paths: The Cursed One

If the Cursed One is present, then the Lotus Witch reveals
that their curse originates on the island of Typhon, and
only there can the curse be broken. If they can answer her
riddles, then she will give them a protective artifact. Refer
to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

The Lotus Witch asks the party four questions about
the history of Thylea. Feel free to choose simple questions that you know your party can easily answer. If you
need ideas, here are some examples:

• Who created the Myrmekes race? (Talieus)
• Who was the first of the Dragonlords? (Xander)
• Who was the cruelest of the Dragonlords? (Estor)
• What happened to the City of the Sirens? (It sank.)
• When Thylea bore fruit, which two Titans sprang
from a single pit? (Sydon and Lutheria)

The sphinx will be satisfied if the heroes can answer
three of the questions correctly. If this is the case, she
will answer any five questions the heroes ask of her: she
knows everything there is to know about Thylea and its
history. After answering any questions she will send the
heroes on their way; they will reappear outside of the
tower and will be unable to gain entry ever again.

The Missing Dragons

Fighting the Lotus Witch
If the heroes attack the Lotus Witch or fail to answer her
questions, she attacks them. The tower is considered
her lair, so she has access to all of her lair actions. The

This is an excellent opportunity for players to learn more
about the dragons that went missing during the First War.
The Lotus Witch knows what happened to the dragons,
but she is forbidden to reveal it due to the Oath of Peace.
The most she can say is that the dragons may reveal
themselves to the heroes when the Oath has ended.
If the party has not yet received Aesop's letter, they
should probably receive it before visiting the Lotus Witch.
Refer to the Voyage of the Ultros for details.

Indigo Island




Your ship glides through clear blue waters towards a
rocky and verdant shore. A crescent archipelago to
the south creates a lagoon between the sea and main
island. Through the clear green water of the lagoon,
you can see jagged rocks and coral reefs that must be
carefully avoided. Fishing boats dot the coastline of the
island, each dragging several large nets.


This island is heavily forested, and it has many beaches
that make excellent landings. The waters around the
island are dangerous, with many reefs and sharp rocks.
This is the home of the seafaring Indigo barbarians.
The humans, elves, dwarves, and others in the Indigo
Tribes inhabited the Cerulean Gulf islands long before
the coming of the Dragonlords.

History of the Indigo Tribes
More than a thousand years ago, hundreds of survivors
from a series of shipwrecks washed ashore on the Gulf 's
150

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf



islands. They were helped by the native races, including
the nymphs and satyrs, and they were eventually able
to build a fleet of small ships to sail the Cerulean Gulf.
They discovered Indigo Island and settled here, calling
themselves the Indigo Tribes, after the fields of dark
blue flowers that carpet the island.
When the Dragonlords came, the Indigo Tribes
fought on the side of the Thylean natives as a naval
force. They scored several significant victories, but
they went back into hiding after the end of the First
War. They have remained here for the past five centuries. Although the island's forests are plentiful with
deer and boar, the tribes mostly depend upon fishing
and raiding.

Barbarian Raiders
Civilized, mainland Thyleans dismiss the Indigo
Tribes as uncultured barbarians, worthy only of scorn.
However, their fearlessness and naval prowess also
inspire respect: the barbarians frequently raid settlements along the Cerulean Gulf.

The Indigo barbarians are the best navigators in all
of Thylea. They observe flocks of birds and track the
movements of stars to travel the Cerulean Gulf. They
consider their navigation skills to be sacred and would
never share their techniques with an outsider. Some
travel to Mytros and Estoria to experience the decadent
lifestyle of the "mainlanders," but all of them eventually
return to their island home.
The Indigo Tribes dress lightly and wield unusual
steel weapons, which have been handed down from
their ancestors, or forged by dwarves of the Whale tribe,
rather than the common bronze weapons used on the
mainland. They are tanned by wind and sun from time
at sea. The most exotic part of their appearance are the
spiraling patterns of blue tattoos that cover their bodies.
Indigo barbarians wear tattoos to mark every significant
event in their lives.
There are several tribes on the island, each including
several hundred members. The tribes are divided along
racial lines, but they are united in their reverence of
Thylea, the Great Mother. Each tribe is ruled by a chief

and two or three thanes (CN barbarian warriors). The
tribes are defended by a core group of fearless warriors
(CN berserkers), but all of the men and women in the
tribe are able to fight (CN tribal warriors).

Tribe of the Shark
The largest tribe is made up of humans, half-elves, tieflings, and half-orcs. It is ruled by Gorac, an exceedingly
tall and slender half-elf (CN barbarian warrior).

Tribe of the Dolphin
This tribe of elves is the most xenophobic of the islanders, and they are the masters of building the catamaran-style boats used by the Indigo barbarians to travel
the Gulf. The boats are built so that they can be easily
dismantled and hidden. They even have masts that
can be used as a rain-catcher for fresh water on long
voyages. The tribe is ruled by Dolphin, an elven woman
(CN wild druid). This name is taken by anyone who
becomes chieftain.
Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

151

Tribe of the Whale
This tribe of dwarves keeps to the central forest on the
island. They run a mining operation that works a small
iron deposit, the only one known in all of Thylea. The
iron ore is difficult to mine due to its scarcity even here,
so the steel weapons made by the dwarves are valued by
all the tribes. They are led by Delg (CG gladiator). He
dresses in the armor of his forebears: adamantine half
plate and shield (giving him AC 19).

Tribe of the Eel
This tribe of halflings and gnomes lives close to the
beaches, and they are the best fishermen on the island.
They are also the most gregarious and welcoming of the
tribes. Their leader, Loopywoopy (CG barbarian warrior), a female gnome, is famed for her ability to stretch
even the most mundane story into an epic, sprawling
myth for all the ages!

of her victims. The cave also has the small hoard that
she has begun to accumulate.
Treasure
The dragon's hoard contains 100 pp and 5,000 gp. The
coins are piled around a pedestal on which rests a single
glowing orb of star metal.

Event: Proving
The tribe of the Eel has decided to prove itself
against the heroes, whom they call "outsiders." Chief
Loopywoopy takes one of her thanes and leads a dozen
berserkers in an attack against the party. Loopywoopy
announces beforehand that this battle is a ritual and
not to the death. Her twelve barbarians (CG barbarian
warriors) will not use lethal force unless the heroes use
it against them. Read the following:


Twelve short tattooed humanoids approach your party.
Though their tiny faces contort themselves in expressions meant to convey menace, their weapons remain
sheathed. A middle-aged gnome approaches you with
a confident stride. She wears an ornate headdress that
nearly swallows her features.
"I, Chief Loopywoopy of the great Tribe of the Eel,
wish to welcome you to Indigo Island! Do you outsiders
care to prove your might against my people's greatest
warriors? Stow your weapons! Testing your mettle
requires no bloodshed."

1. The Dragon
A few months ago, an evil metallic dragon came to
the island and claimed it as hunting territory. Ventis
(CE adult copper dragon) came from Praxys. Sydon
hatched and raised her at his tower, and he's released
her to hunt and grow stronger before his war begins.
Ventis has taken to hunting the barbarians as food.
Unlike most of her kind, Ventis is chaotic evil, as she
has been raised from birth to hate any outsider race
that settled in Thylea. Ventis lives in a cave near the
center of the forest, her presence shown by the bones



If the heroes are able to defeat the band, they are asked
to a great feast in their honor. At the feast, satyrs play
music, nymphs dance in the moonlight, and the gnomes
and halflings drink copious amounts of liquor. The drink
is a sweet-tasting rum made from sugarcane found deep
in the island interior. Read the following:


Part way through the feast, Ventis the copper dragon
attacks. She uses her acid breath and then starts killing
indiscriminately. Read the following:


The festivities are cut short by a most unwelcome
guest. The triangular silhouette of a copper dragon
glides in front of the full moon and swoops down to
attack the party. Firelight reflects from her glimmering
metallic scales. She spews a stream of acid that singes
the edge of Chief Loopywoopy's headdress.



The full moon hangs in the clear night sky, providing
a picturesque backdrop for the feast. Satyrs serenade
you with their pipes while nymphs, halflings, and
gnomes dance around the flickering fire. You never
quite finish your sweet, potent drink, as your hosts
are quick to fill your cup back up to its brim. The air
is thick with the smell of alcohol, smoked fish, and
fresh sweat.










As soon as Ventis takes more than 20 damage, she uses
her slowing breath and retreats back to her lair. Chief
Loopwoopy will try to convince the heroes to go after
her. Loopwoopy explains that the dragon has been collecting a hoard of treasure from the surrounding islands.

Titan's Folly
This strange island consists of three perfectly molded green
hills surrounded by an impossible glass dome that rises
out of the Cerulean Gulf. The glass dome encompasses the
entire island. The wall is impervious to damage, but it can
easily be bypassed by teleportation magic such as teleport
or dimension door. Anchoring at the glass wall is trivial.
Most natives of Thylea know of the legend of the
island and will share it with the heroes. Any crewmen
on the Ultros will almost certainly know that this is
Titan's Folly. They are quite sure that this a place that
must be avoided at all costs.
While the island is rumored to be home to Thylea's
greatest treasures, it was sealed away by Kentimane
the Hundred Handed. His reasons for doing this are
a complete mystery, even to the other gods. Legend
suggests that the original war among the Titans was a
direct result of whatever happened here. Thylean natives
among the crew will warn the heroes to turn away and
forget they ever saw this place.

Wall of Dreams
Anyone who sees the wall will have strange dreams the
following night. They might dream of fantastic magic
items or something that they desire above all else.
For example, paladins may dream of a holy avenger,
wizards may dream of a staff of the magi, and rogues
may dream of a cloak of invisibility. In the dream, ants
carry the desired item from a miniature version of the
island and drop it at the feet of the hero.

eh? I bet
Titan's Folly! Now there's a mystery,
nymphs
it's full of glittering gold and beautiful
s says
and glorious battles! But my sister Vallu
that we are never to go there. Ah well.

- Pythor, God of Battle

If the heroes bypass the wall, read the following:




Once you have bypassed the curious glass dome, you
continue toward the island. The most striking aspect of
the place is its perfect geometric uniformity. The land
consists of three identical green hills clumped together.
Thick tropical grass grows in rows around each hill,
interrupted only by rows of oak trees halfway to each
hill's summit. Such a perfect land formation can only be
the handiwork of the Mother Goddess, Thylea.




The three hills are entirely covered in perfectly arranged
fields of sugarcane. Each hill has a ring of ancient oak trees
that circles the hill at the midpoint of the slope. Under the
oak trees are entrances to a network of caves and tunnels.
The Titan Kentimane sealed this island away five millennia ago. It hasn't had a single visitor from the outside
world in all that time. Inside the barrier, on this strange
island, lives a race of creatures that don't exist anywhere
else in the multiverse: the myrmekes.
The myrmekes are a race of hyper-intelligent insectlike humanoids that were created by one of Thylea's
children at the dawn of time. There are around 3,000
myrmekes on the island, and they live in the caves
beneath the oaks, where they store their food, raise their
young and protect their queen.
Meeting the Myrmekes
When they are met initially, the myrmekes can only
communicate with clicks and by waving their antenna.
They provoke no hostility. They bring out sumptuous
offerings of food and drink. The food tastes like a form
of delicious meat, while the drink is a sweet wine.
Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

Warm Greetings. Within a few hours on interacting
with the heroes they will begin to communicate using
the language that the heroes use. They are extremely
social creatures who will warmly greet strangers to
the island. They are also extremely curious. They ask
the heroes many questions-about their deeds, hopes,
desires, and goals: anything and everything will provoke
the myrmekes into asking a question.
The myrmekes are very accommodating, and can be
light-hearted and funny. They won't stop the heroes
from leaving early, and they will not restrict the party's
movements on the island. If the heroes attack the myrmekes, they will defend themselves but will not retaliate.
They will wait until the heroes exhaust themselves and
then ask them, somewhat regretfully, to leave.
Explaining the Dome. If the myrmekes are asked
about the dome, they will claim that it was erected to
trap them, as a punishment for insulting a powerful god,
thousands of years ago. They will dispute the notion that
Thylea imprisoned them, as she was their creator. If they
are asked about powerful magical items, they will claim
to have no ideas about such things. The truth is that the
myrmekes' powerful hive mind is able to influence the
unconscious minds of nearby humanoids.

Event: A World of Dirt
The myrmekes study everything that the heroes do and
everything that they bring with them. Magic spells are
especially interesting to them, as they have very little
experience with magic.
Once the heroes have left the island, the myrmekes
will begin to plan their escape from the island. They will
copy whatever method the heroes used to bypass the
wall. For example, if the heroes used the dimension door
spell, then the myrmekes now know how to use it.
At this point the myrmekes will begin working toward
what they feel is their destiny: making the multiverse a
reflection of their perfect society and people.

They will then send boats to the mainland where they
will capture Thyleans and learn everything they can
from them. This happens very quickly while the heroes
are busy with their own affairs. Within a few weeks, the
heroes might have the following encounter:




A fine galley ship sails towards your party. As it
approaches, you find that the vessel is crewed and
captained by a group of humanoid insects, the curious
myrmekes you encountered not long ago.
Despite the short amount of time that has passed,
the myrmekes have changed considerably. They now
wear bronze armor and wield bronze weapons. They
are no longer the friendly and inquisitive creatures of
Titan's Folly. As these myrmekes approach, they look
positively defiant and warlike.


The ship is crewed by 30 myrmekes warriors. The
myrmekes will attack the party's ship using tactics that
would impress even the most jaded Aresian warrior
monk. Six myrmekes warriors bombard the heroes with
rays of frost as a disciplined phalanx of ten myrmekes
warriors attempts to board the ship.
If the heroes are able to survive this encounter, they
begin to hear rumors of armies of insect men conquering outlying towns and villages. Initially the stories
describe armies of hundreds of myrmekes, but after one
month, the rumors describe an unstoppable army of
more than a thousand myrmekes with advanced magic
and siege weapons.
The myrmekes grow more advanced with each passing month, and the size of their army doubles just as
quickly. If they aren't stopped, they will conquer all of
Thylea and convert it into one giant ant colony. Then
they will seek out new lands to conquer. These events
are beyond the scope of this book, but they might form
the basis of a future campaign.

Fire Island




Crystal clear blue water and a handful of smaller islands
surround the landmass you are approaching. Dense
tropical foliage covers the islands, and you can hear the
cacophonous sounds of abundant wildlife.
An impressive black mountain rises from the jungle
at the center of the main island, and the smell of
smoke and brimstone hangs in the air.


154

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf



Fire Island is almost completely surrounded by a coral
reef, although careful seamanship can find a channel
through the shoal waters. Beyond the coral reef, the
waters are calm and a ship can easily anchor.
As its name suggests, Fire Island is formed around an
active volcano, which occasionally belches ash and fiery
embers into the air, making it dangerous to approach.
Currently, the volcano is quiet, with just a thin trail of
smoke snaking into the sky above the caldera.

Lizardfolk Tribes
Fire Island is inhabited by several tribes of lizardfolk,
who are engaged in endless, brutal wars against one
other. The strongest tribe boasts 350 warriors. They
are called the Firewalkers, because they control the
land around the central volcano.
The Firewalkers
The Firewalkers are led by Jankor (NE lizard king),
who is served by three lizardfolk shamans and a pair
of cyclopes. A flock of pteranodons that have been
domesticated by the tribe can be seen flying during the
day, hunting or spying on the other lizardfolk tribes.
The Lesser Tribes
Three lesser tribes, comprising several hundred warriors
each, control the outer parts of the island. Each of these
tribes is led by a lizard queen with a lizardfolk shaman
as an advisor.
The Nameless God
All the lizardfolk of Fire Island, regardless of tribal
loyalty, worship a nameless deity that they believe sleeps
deep below the Cerulean Gulf. Firewalker shamans regularly sacrifice captives taken in battle, whether lizardfolk or outsiders, by hurling them into a volcanic fissure
to feed their sleeping god.

Creatures of Fire Island
Other than lizardfolk, the island has bountiful animal
life, including boar, deer, and other smaller mammals.
The streams and ponds of the island are often hunting
grounds for crocodiles or constrictor snakes. Giant
lizards are also plentiful on the island and have been
domesticated by all of the tribes as beasts of burden.

Sydon's Chosen Tribe
Vytha explains that the Firewalkers have been chosen by
Sydon to dominate Fire Island. The Lord of Storms gave
Jankor a powerful magical artifact and two cyclopes as
servants. In exchange, Jankor gave the Titan one of the
three brass dragon eggs that were hidden on the island.
Vytha believes that the other two eggs may be located
somewhere on in the volcano village.
Sydon's Interest in Fire Island
Tribes of lizardfolk wouldn't normally warrant the attention of the Lord of Storms. Sydon has intervened here
because his sister Chalcia is sealed away beneath the volcano, and he wishes to keep it that way. She is the 'sleeping god' worshipped by the lizardfolk. The Firewalkers'
daily sacrifices to the volcano ensure that this magical
seal remains intact.

The Celebratory Feast
If the heroes agree to assist her, Queen Vytha will hold
a great feast in their honor. She proudly explains that
her son is to be sacrificed and served as the celebratory meal. The heroes can turn down this "honorable
banquet," but in this case, Vytha will be insulted. She
believes that they are greedily demanding that she sacrifice one of her older, larger sons instead.

KEY LOCATIONS

The Brass Dragon
Centuries ago, the island was also home to an adult
brass dragon. However, it was killed by the Kraken
during one of its hunts over the nearby coral reefs. The
lizardfolk still tell stories of the battle between the two
creatures. The dragon left behind three dragon eggs,
which the lizardfolk have long sought after.

The Firewalkers dwell in a large wooden fort over
the mouth of the volcano. Jankor rules from here and
makes regular sacrifices by tossing victims into the
fiery pit.
The fort is constructed from sturdy wood, bamboo,
and thick vines. Some exotic materials have also been
used, including the shells of young dragon turtles and
the skeletal vertebrae from an enormous worm of some
kind. The main platform is level with the lip of the caldera, while other platforms step down into the volcano.
Many of the platforms are level with caves and tunnels
that have been dug into the wall of the caldera.

The Lizard Queen

Secret Path

When the heroes first land, they will be approached by
a lizardfolk shaman who is escorted by six lizardfolk.
They will ask the heroes to accompany them to see their
queen, who lives on the outskirts of the jungle.
Vytha (NE lizard queen) will implore the heroes
to aid her in defeating her mortal enemy, Jankor, the
king of the Firewalkers. She describes how Jankor has
corrupted the lizardfolk by turning away from the god in
the volcano and making sacrifices to Sydon instead.

A secret path provides another way into the fort. Vytha
knows the location of this path and will tell the heroes to
search for it on the north end of the caldera.

Platforms
All of the platforms in the fort are built on pillars of
bamboo and wood. Each is at least 10 ft. above the
surface of the caldera. It is possible to climb from the
caldera surface to a platform using the pillars, but this
requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

157

V1. Main Entrance




The spine of some massive creature serves as a bridge
to the lizard king's fort. Ash darkens the crevices of the
otherwise bleached white bone. Even as the hot sun
beats down from a cloudless sky, you can sense an even
more oppressive heat radiating up from below.




The bridge leads from the caldera lip to the topmost
platform of the fort. It is guarded by four lizardfolk and
two salamanders. They will fight to the death.
The bridge was made from the vertebrae of a purple
worm, which came to the surface decades ago and died.
This happened on the same day that Jankor hatched, and
it was taken as a sign of his divine right to rule.

V2. Stables


V4. Secret Entrance








This large platform is where the giant lizard mounts
used by the lizardfolk are kept. Six giant lizards are
tethered to three stakes, and four lizardfolk keep
watch and care for the mounts. If the lizardfolk spot
any intruders, they will free the giant lizards and order
them to attack. The giant lizards are docile unless commanded to attack by one of the lizardfolk.

V3. Throne Room




The lizard king's throne room is located within what
appears to be an immense hollow turtle shell. Inside,
the king lounges upon his throne on a raised platform
in the center of the room. He is listening intently to
his advisor and drumming his clawed fingers against an
ornately-carved staff.
A fiery reptilian creature stands to one side of the
king. It has a muscular, humanoid upper body that
snakes down into a coiling tail. Even so, the most striking member of the king's party is a tiny, copper-colored
dragon that snores fitfully at his feet.


The throne room is built inside the enormous shell of
a dragon turtle. Jankor, the chosen mouthpiece of the
great god Sydon, claims to have killed the dragon turtle
with the help of the Lord of Storms. The truth is that its
corpse washed ashore after the creature died of old age.
Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf



Carefully hidden from prying eyes, a narrow stairway
has been carved into the cliff side. Below, a faint
orange glow shines through cracks in the volcano's dark
crust, betraying the inferno beneath.



You come to a platform with a tethered group of
horse-sized monitor lizards that are being tended to by
lizardfolk. Despite their monstrous bulk and appearance, the large reptiles are docile. They occasionally
flick their tongues and grunt at their handlers.

158

Jankor (NE lizard king) has 120 hit points and carries
a staff of thunder and lightning. This staff was a gift
from Sydon, and it is the symbol of Jankor's right to
rule. Jankor is always accompanied by a loyal salamander and a bloodthirsty lizardfolk shaman. The brass
dragon wyrmling curled around his feet hatched one
year ago, and it is completely loyal to him.
Jankor is not immediately hostile to intruders, but
he will interrogate them and demand to know for what
purpose they have trespassed in his territory.
In battle, Jankor will use his staff to send out lightning
strikes against his foes. When reduced to 60 hit points,
he will use the thunder and lightning ability even if
that means hurting his own people. He will then try to
retreat to his chambers (V12).



A narrow path carved into the volcano winds down to
the egg chambers. This treacherous and narrow path is
not marked and requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check to find it. In two places, the path has
been deliberately weakened, and someone not aware of
these passive traps must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving
throw when they step on the weakened section. Spotting
the weakened sections requires a DC 16 Wisdom
(Perception) check.
When stepped upon, the ground will crumble away,
and a failed saving throw causes one to plummet into
the caldera below. The drop will break through the crust
into the magma, causing 55 (10d10) fire damage to the
unfortunate creature that fell.

V5. Egg chambers




These chambers are relatively bare, except for the large
stone bowls scattered around the room that have been
gently packed with eggs and straw. Bright orangeand-red frilled snakes the size of men curl motionless
around each bowl. Two lizardfolk elders tend the
bowls, gingerly turning the eggs inside.



This cave is where the lizardfolk eggs are kept. The
eggs are kept warm, and guarded, by a half-dozen fire
snakes. Two lizardfolk shamans tend to the fire snakes
and the eggs. Both the shamans and fire snakes will
attack trespassers who enter the cave.



V6. Sleeping Chambers


V8. Chamber of worship




The chamber has three pairs of poles stuck into the
base of the platform. Sturdy nets and sheets have been
tied between these poles a few feet from the floor to
make hammocks. Three small wooden chests sit underneath these structures.




These platforms are where the lizardfolk sleep. At night,
there are always at least two lizardfolk asleep on the
hammocks. They make soft hissing sounds.
Treasure. There are three chests in the chamber. Each
chest contains 2d6 assorted gemstones worth 10 gp
each. Some of the gems are covered in dried blood.

V7. Wooden Walkways




Unlike the other walkways that connect the platforms
of the fort, this walkway has a pair of bronze stakes
on either end that holds it in place. The walkway is
thick and appears quite sturdy. A formidable-looking
lizardfolk with a large curved horn hanging at its waist
stands watch at the other end of the walkway.




You come to a large platform built upon half of an
enormous turtle shell. At the center of this space, two
lizardfolk shamans pray to a carved wooden statue
of an imposing man wielding a black glaive. The altar
beneath the statue has been carved with patterns
resembling waves and stained green-blue. Green gems
glitter from the statue's three eye sockets.




This is the second largest platform in the complex and is
the other side of the enormous shell of a dragon turtle.
The chamber's central feature is a 10 ft. tall wooden
statue of Sydon. During the day there are always two
lizardfolk shamans in this room, along with the king's
consort, a lazy lizard queen. These three will attack
intruders and fight to the death.
Treasure. The three eyes of the statue of Sydon are
emeralds worth 500 gp each. When the heroes touch the
statue, they hear a peal of thunder from the sky above.

V9. Cyclops Cave



Each of the marked walkways is guarded by a lizardfolk.
Each of these lizardfolk has a horn, and if they see enemies approaching, they will blow a fanfare to summon
four pteranodons from their roosts. It takes the pteranodons one round to arrive and attack.
The Walkway Traps
The walkways are sturdy, but the lizardfolk have built
them so that they can be easily destroyed in the event
of an invasion. On each side of the walkways are two
bronze stakes. Pulling out a stake requires a successful
DC 10 Strength check.
Pulling out a single stake makes a walkway bridge
unstable, and anyone on it must make a DC 10 Dexterity
saving throw or be thrown into the caldera below.
Anyone who does so will break through the crust into
the magma and take 55 (10d10) fire damage.
Pulling both stakes out makes the bridge collapse,
and anyone less than 10 feet from one end can attempt
a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to leap to safety. Those
who are close to the center of the walkway must make a
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to make the leap. Failure
means falling into the magma.
The King's Escape. When under attack, the lizardfolk
guards will wait until there is at least one enemy on the
walkway before removing a stake. However, if the lizard
king is fleeing from a pursuit by the heroes, he will
order his warriors to pull out one pin after he has safely
passed. They will wait until the heroes are crossing the
walkway to pull out the other stake.



Although a modest forge has been built into one side
of this cave, it is noticeably cooler in here than in the
rest of the fort. The cave's sole resident, a 9-foot-tall
cyclops, sits at a stone table at the center of the room.
He wears a monocle over his eye, and he has remarkably nimble, ten-fingered hands. He is tinkering with
what appears to be a half-finished mechanical goat.
Other clockwork animals fill niches that have been
carved into the cavern wall opposite the forge.




The smith is Steros (see appendix). He is a jancan, a rare
breed of cyclops born with ten fingers on each hand and
ten toes on each foot. Jancan are natural blacksmiths,
although Steros is unusual in that he is somewhat of a
runt when compared to most of his kind.
Steros is not immediately hostile, and will try to make
conversation with anyone who enters his forge. He will,
however, use the power of his monocle to gain the upper
hand in any conversation or battle that takes place.
Steros the Jancan
Sydon sent Steros to serve the Firewalkers after their
previous jancan was captured in a raid by the Amazons
of Themis. The previous jancan was named Bront, and
he was Steros's father.
Since his arrival, Steros has built himself a small
forge that he keeps heated with the help of a pair of
fire snakes. Using this forge, he builds weapons for the
Firewalkers, a task that he considers to be beneath his
considerable skills. He spends most of his time tinkering
Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

159

Steros the Jancan

The Jancan's Request
Steros will switch to his blue lens in an attempt to charm
one of the heroes and convince them to find his missing
father. If they are willing to help him find Bront, then
he will build the heroes a mechanical animal of their
choice. However, the heroes must allow him to accompany them on their ship.
If he is threatened, Steros will release the fire snakes
as a bonus action, command any charmed heroes to
summon Firewalker reinforcements, and use the three
lenses to blast his enemies.
The Jancan's Contraptions
Steros's contraptions are mechanical versions of the
animals created by figurines of wondrous power. The owl
and the dog in this room work exactly like a serpentine
owl and an onyx dog. However, they will break down
after every six uses, or if they are reduced to 0 hit points.
The only way to repair them is to use tinker's tools, and
the repairer must be proficient with them.
If the heroes agree to help Steros, then he will build
them their own mechanical beast. This will take him a
week of work aboard the Ultros. He can build a mechanical version of a golden lion, ivory goat of traveling,
serpentine owl, silver raven, or onyx dog.
The jancan's monocle is built for someone Large-sized
with the same poor eyesight as Steros. It cannot be used
except by someone with the same unique anatomy.

V10. Sacrificial Promontory

brilliant smiths be born to common cyclopes, who barely
possess the power of speech? They are a rarity, to be sure,

These mechanical contraptions are arranged in niches
carved into the cave. There are many creatures in the
niches, some of them unfinished, others smashed.
Steros' most prized possession is the monocle that
he wears at all times. This has several lenses that can be
used, by swinging them into place inside the short frame:

• Red lens acts as eyes of the eagle.
• Blue lens acts as eyes of charming.
• Green lens acts as eyes of minute seeing.
• All three lenses together act as a circlet of blasting that

time, over the next three days. They will be suitably
grateful if rescued, and will accompany the heroes
and even fight for them if they are given any weapons.
Otherwise, they will flee to their home settlements.

Polyphorus will use the final check to try to devour his
opponent. He was lying about the weapon.

V12. King's Chambers




An obsidian entranceway leads into an artificial cave
dug into the side of the cliff. The furnishings within this
chamber are considerably more opulent than anywhere
else in the fort, with vivid silks, gilded furniture, and
voluminous pillows. At the chamber's center, steam
rises from a stone vessel filled with crystalline liquid.
Four large, brightly colored snakes slither around the
vessel, pressing their bodies against it.


V14. The Volcano






The entrance to the king's chambers is built on another
obsidian promontory in the volcano's side. The cave has
been dug into the wall of the caldera. It includes a bath
which is heated by four fire snakes. Jankor will make his
final stand here after he has retreated from the throne
room. He will order the fire snakes to attack.
Treasure. Jankor keeps his valuables in a pit sealed
with a locked bronze lid. Inside are 400 gp, 1,100 sp, two
emeralds worth 500 gp, and a sapphire worth 1,000 gp.

V15. Salamander Cave






Two black and orange creatures inhabit this largely
empty cavern. Each has a muscular humanoid torso
that tapers into an equally impressive serpent tail. To
one side of the cave is a clutch of large eggs sitting in a
stone nest. Some of the eggs are cracked open.



Inside this dark cave, an elderly, 15-foot-tall cyclops
sits on the ground. He appears to be in deep thought,
although his single eye is unfocused. He seems to have
been a powerful warrior in the past, but his once-muscular frame is now shrunken and bony with age.



The volcano basin is active and magma often bubbles through the crust. Fire snakes swim below in the
magma, and they can sense movement. Each round that
someone walks across the crust, there is a 10% chance
that a fire snake will attack from below.
The fire snake's target must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or fall into the lava. Walking across the
crust inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage per round, while falling
into magma inflicts 55 (10d10) fire damage per round.

V13. The Blind Elder




A thick crust of cooled volcanic rock covers most of the
caldera floor. Magma bubbles through in some places, and
the surface is covered in a network of glowing cracks. An
overwhelming smell of sulfur and smoke hangs in the air.





This cave is the home of Polyphorus, a blind cyclops,
and the chief advisor of King Jankor. Blindness has made
him different from other cyclopes. He is wiser (Wisdom
12) because of the time he spends lost in his own
thoughts, and he won't attack immediately.
Polyphorus has a keen sense of smell, giving him
advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely
upon smell (passive Perception 13). He has grown tired
of the food that the Firewalkers bring him, and he has a
powerful craving for mortal flesh.
When Polyphorus is alerted to intruders, he will sniff
the air and ask them to identify themselves. Once his
curiosity is satisfied, he will challenge one of the heroes
to an arm-wrestling match. He explains that if he loses,



A mated pair of salamanders dwell in this cave. These
salamanders are loyal to whichever of the lizardfolk
controls the volcano fort. They routinely give their
young fire snakes to King Jankor as tribute. There are
two freshly hatched fire snakes and a half-dozen other
eggs in the chamber.
Dragon Egg. One of the eggs in the salamander's nest
is different than the others. This is a brass dragon egg
that was left behind by the dragon that once laired on
Fire Island. The salamanders recently discovered the egg
and have been trying to hatch it.

History of Yonder




As your ship approaches this rocky island, a shallow
cove appears to be the best spot to lay anchor. Stained
and charred white marble and concrete ruins dot
the shore, and you can clearly see the bones of giant
humanoids. The relatively intact structures have doorways that are unusually tall and wide.
A tower near the cove is the only complete building
in sight. Although recently built, its foundations are

a window in the tower, a six-armed cyclops looks out
at the sea, your ship, and you.

The Order of Sydon
The Island of Yonder has been taken over by the Order
of Sydon, a faction of zealots who are fiercely devoted to
Sydon, the Lord of Storms.
The Order intends to destroy the heroes. They are an
effective, organized force. Unlike some other groups in
the Cerulean Gulf, the Order of Sydon are highly coordinated and prepared for interlopers. This makes them far
more difficult to deal with than most of the dangers that
the heroes have encountered so far.
Gaius, the commander of the Order, is a very clever
leader and a cunning strategist. He will not throw away

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

This island was the ancient capital of the Gygan Empire
that once dominated much of Thylea. The gygans were
already in decline when the Dragonlords arrived, but
most of those that remained were wiped out in the First
War. The gygan communities and forts on Yonder were
razed by the Dragonlords in the last days of the struggle.
In the last decade, the Order of Sydon has made the
island their main base of operations. The few gygans
who still lived on the island were eager to work with the
Order and thereby gain favor with Sydon. They believe
that this, perhaps, is a chance to return to the glory of
ages past.
Structures and Ruins
Two buildings have been mostly reconstructed by the
Order and the gygans. One is a small tower close to the
cove that allows landfall. The other is a magnificent
library near the center of the island. The rest of the
island is covered in ruins from the ancient gygan civilization. There are a half-dozen sites that show broken
marble pillars and slabs of concrete, some of which are
partially charred by dragon fire.
The skeletal remains of gygans are everywhere in
these ruins. The few living gygans avoided the ruins out
of superstitious fear of the long dead. There are animals
on the island, but they are mostly seagulls and small
animals such as rats and shrews.

Ancient Grievances
The many ruins across the island have been mostly
picked clean by the Order of Sydon. All that remains
are the bones of the gygans who died five centuries ago.
The gygans who still live on Yonder leave these bones in
the open as a reminder of the evils that the Dragonlords
visited upon their people.
Because of the atrocities of Estor Arkelander, the
Ultros is a ship that the gygans have never forgotten, and
anyone who comes to the island aboard the legendary
ship will be an immediate target of the gygans' wrath.

in the tower unless ordered otherwise by Gaius or
Chondrus. However, if the Ultros makes anchor within
visible range of the tower, Marcion will be unable to stop
the two gygans in his garrison from going down to try
and kill anyone coming to shore.
Encounter: Confrontation
If Gaius learns that the heroes have made landfall, he
will send a war party to confront them.


An armored man riding a bull approaches you. His
steed is completely encased in metallic scales. He
wears a cerulean cape and a breastplate that has been
engraved with a red eye, the symbol of Sydon. A group
of soldiers and a six-armed cyclops march behind him.
As soon as they see your party, the monstrous bulls
charge toward you with a thunderous roar!

1. Garrison of Soldiers
This tower's main purpose is to house a small garrison
of soldiers who protect the island and the Library. The
tower is guarded by a detachment of 16 soldiers from
the Order of Sydon and 2 gygans led by Marcion (LE
captain). One of the gygans is always on watch and will
alert the tower if he sees a ship approaching.
Once Marcion becomes aware of the heroes, he will
send one of his men to inform Gaius at the library.
Marcion will try to ensure that the garrison remains

Gaius has sent one of his captains mounted on a
gorgon, along with one gygan and six soldiers.

2. Ancient Library
The ancient library, now rebuilt, is in the middle of a
ruined gygan city. It is both the headquarters of the
Order's supreme commander and the location of the
Order's most important project. The path here from the
cove is easy to spot, as it is frequently used.
Sydon is obsessed with arcane lore and the Order are
gathering such knowledge from as many unique sources
as possible. They have been using three main methods:

• Gathering scrolls and tomes from across Thylea.
• Capturing shipwrecked sailors from the outer world.
• Using all sorts of magic to learn forbidden secrets.
Most of the Order think that the library is somehow
giving them information through such spells as contact
other plane and legend lore, but this is not all that has
been happening. Chondrus, the master of the library,
has been making deals with the yugoloths of Hades. The
library also has a half-dozen scholars (LE nobles) to
tend to the books and scrolls, along with four acolytes
who study arcane lore, conduct magical experiments,
and use divination magic to look beyond Thylea.
Finally, the library is also home to soldiers and gygans
under command of Gaius, the supreme commander of
the Order of Sydon.
Cliffs
The cliffs surrounding the library are 200 ft. in height.
The cliffs are steep and require a successful DC 15
Strength (Athletics) check to scale. The Order of Sydon
doesn't patrol the cliffs, so it's a dangerous but effective
way to stealthily gain entry to the library.
Doors
The doors of the library are all built for Large-sized
humanoids. Medium and smaller creatures need to use
an action to open the doors here.
Rousing the garrison
While Gaius may have learned that strangers have made
landfall on Yonder, he is confident that sending out one
of his captains should deal with the threat. The garrison
at the library will not become alert until intruders are
seen approaching the gates-or until a fight breaks out
inside the walls. If the library is alerted to intruders, all
of the soldiers in both barracks will be roused. The walls
and towers at the front gate will be reinforced, and a
warband will be dispatched to intercept the heroes. The
warband includes six soldiers, one gygan, and a captain
with orders to kill the heroes.
Commander Gaius
If the library hasn't been alerted, then Gaius can be
encountered in his quarters. However, if Gaius is alerted
to intruders, he will summon his mount, Argyn (LE
young silver dragon), and wait for her before engaging
in battle. Gaius can summon Argyn by blowing a whistle
that hangs around his neck.
164

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

Argyn is usually hunting dolphins and whales in the
waters close to the island, and it will take her about ten
minutes to return. If the heroes leave the library before
Argyn arrives, then Gaius will mount up and search for
their ship from the air. Once he finds the ship, he will
attempt to kill everyone onboard. If the heroes have not
yet encountered Sydon's fleet, then he may summon
them to his aid.

KEY LOCATIONS
Y1. Main Entrance




This road leads to a ruined city, which stands at the top
of a plateau. At the center of the ruined city is a massive
structure which appears to have been built by giants.
Color variations in the masonry suggest that this is an
ancient building that has recently been restored. The
massive bronze doors at the entrance stand closed. They
are engraved with images depicting six-armed cyclopes.
Despite the pristine condition of the building itself,
the statuary and carvings that surround it are crumbling. The most prominent statue is a six-armed figure
with a bronze cage where its head should be.




This is the entrance to the library, and the building is
in excellent condition. The statuary is mostly in ruins,
because none of the gygans on the island are artisans
capable of repairing such stonework. The two massive
bronze doors are always kept closed, but they are not
locked. The bronze doors are embossed with images
from the ancient gygan civilization, including scenes of
the gygans building their cities, worshipping the Titans,
and sailing the seas of Thylea.
Alarm Golem. The headless gygan statue is a stone
golem. Even though it has six arms, it still only gets
two slam attacks from its multiattack action. The stone
golem has a movement of 0, but the cage on its head
contains a pair of harpies. When the harpies spot
intruders, they use their luring song to get them to
approach the golem, which then smashes anyone who
comes close enough. Thanks to the cage, the harpies
have the benefit of three-quarters cover.

Y2. Tower
Three soldiers stand atop this tower and keep watch
day and night. If any of the soldiers spot intruders, one
of them will run to the library to alert Gaius.

Y3. Tower and Wall
This tower and wall are left unguarded. However, if the
library is alerted to intruders, all of the soldiers from the
barracks to the north will rush out and take positions at
the top of the tower and along the wall.

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf

165

Y4. Central Courtyard




The library's courtyard is an impressive open space. At
its center is another six armed statue with its head covered by a heavy cloth. Next to the statue is an ornate
fountain that has seen better days. The mechanism
that filled it has long since broken down, and the basin
has run dry.


This is where all the captains and the human soldiers
have their quarters. There is always a captain and six
soldiers present. At night, most of the garrison sleeps
here-a total of two captains and 24 soldiers.
Treasure. There are three chests in this room that
contain the personal items of the soldiers. In total, there
are 224 gp and 640 sp in the chests.

Y7. Gygan Barracks




This is the focal point of the library. The area serves
as a meeting place and a gymnasium. During the day,
the courtyard is always busy, with a captain, six soldiers, and one gygan exercising, eating and socializing.
Occasionally, scholars pass through, moving between
research assignments. If the library is alerted, all of the
soldiers will remain in the courtyard and join any battle
that breaks out at the gates or the stables.
Alarm Golem. The gygan statue is another stone
golem, arranged exactly as the one outside (Y1). In a
similar fashion, there are two harpies in a bronze cage
beneath the cloth. The cage is kept covered by the cloth
during the day, and the harpies sleep. At night, the cloth
is removed, and the harpies act as an alarm system.
Their singing will alert the library of intruders.



Y8. The Stables


The high ceiling of this chamber is supported by many
rows of fluted marble pillars. At the back of the chamber is a massive statue of Sydon. The statue is fifteen
feet in height, even though it sits upon a throne.


The temple is forbidden to everyone except Gaius,
Chondrus, and the acolytes. Any of these individuals
can communicate directly with Sydon by saying a prayer
while kneeling before the statue. There is a 50% chance
that Sydon will respond to such prayer, and the head of
the statue will animate.
Calling upon Sydon. If the library is attacked and the
battle is going poorly for the Order of Sydon, then Gaius
may come here to request advice or reinforcements.
Sydon will instruct Gaius to find his dragon Argyn and
then hunt down the intruders from the air once they
think they are safely away on their ship. If the heroes
have not yet battled against Sydon's fleet, then the Titan
may send the fleet after them at this point.





This room is sparsely furnished with a dozen bunk beds
lined up in two neat rows. Locked wooden chests sit
under several of the bunks.


166

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf





Sydon gifted several gorgons to be used as mounts by
Gaius and his captains. Two are currently kept in the
stables. One sickly gorgon is currently being tended by
two soldiers. The sickly gorgon has rust in his joints
that the soldiers are trying to polish out. As soon as they
notice intruders, the soldiers will attack with the sickly
gorgon (90 HP). The other gorgon will sit quietly in its
stall unless the sickly gorgon is killed.
Berserk Gorgon. The death wail of the sickly gorgon
makes the other gorgon go berserk, and it will try to
break out of its pen. Breaking out of its pen requires a
successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, but it has
advantage due to its enraged state.

Y9. Entrance Hall




This pillared entrance hall has had frescoes recently
painted upon the ceiling. The frescoes portray a great
fleet of ships approaching a city that bears an uncanny
resemblance to Mytros. Flags bearing the symbol of
Sydon fly from the masts of the ships.

Y6. Barracks




These stables are modest but well-maintained. They
house what appear to be two bulls covered in metallic
scales. One of the creatures is thinner than the other,
and its joints are covered in a deep red rust. Two blueclad soldiers are moving rags across the bull's rusted
ankles in forceful circular motions.






This is where all of the gygans have their quarters.
During the day, there is only one gygan sleeping here,
but at night, there are three sleeping in the barracks.

Y5. Temple of Sydon




The furniture in this room has been built to accommodate humanoids much larger than the average man. Its
furnishings are limited to a row of six bunk beds.





The hall is empty. Gaius had his men paint the scene in
anticipation of Sydon's planned invasion. Written across
the top of the mural are the following words in Thylean:
GLORY TO SYDON
THE OATH OF PEACE IS ENDING

Y10. Mess Hall




In the center of this room, a long wooden table is covered in plates, mugs, and utensils of various sizes. Some
are human-sized, while others are sized for giants.


Mikhael has revealed many magical secrets under
interrogation, but he has never revealed his origins. He
is a shadow of his former self, and years of torture have
nearly broken him. If he is freed, he will quickly return
to the vigorous and vainglorious man he was once, years
before his capture. He strongly believes that the engine
of his airship can be salvaged and that he can probably
retrofit it to the Ultros or another ship.
Unless you want the heroes to have such a device,
Mikhael will be disappointed if he ever finds the wreck
of his ship, as the engine has been removed. It is lost
somewhere in the depths of the Cerulean Gulf.

Y12. Commander's Quarters




These two small rooms are largely bare, save for a
single bed, a wooden chest, and a writing desk. One
of the rooms has a small statue of a bearded man with
three eyes. The figure has been carved in a style that
differs significantly from the crumbling statuary you
have encountered on the island thus far.

This room is empty of anything of value. If more than a
minute is spent in the room, there is a 25% chance that a
pair of gygans will arrive with plates of steaming food.

Y11. Prison Cells





This narrow hallway is lined with locked wooden doors.
Two soldiers stand guard. Although you cannot see
into the rooms beyond the doors, you can hear a man's
voice babbling incoherently from behind one of them.
You also notice a heavy keyring hanging from the belt
of one of the soldiers standing guard.


These cells contain prisoners from shipwrecked expeditions from the outer world. The cells are locked
and require a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using
thieves' tools to open. Two soldiers are always present
here as guards. The keys to the cells are carried by one
of the guards.
Prisoner: The Old Man
A crazed, white-haired older man sits in his cell and
babbles endlessly. He no longer knows his name and
bears many scars from torture. If a greater restoration
spell is used on him, he will return to his senses. He
will call himself "Enigma" (CN mage) and he will help
the heroes confront Chondrus if they can return his
spellbook to him. He believes that his spellbook should
be located in the Great Library (Y14), but it is actually
located in the Sleeping Quarters (Y15).







The room with the statue is where Gaius (see appendix)
sleeps and works. The other room is for visiting guests.
Letters from Gaius. Many letters are scattered on
the writing desk in Gaius' room. Mostly these letters
are communications between him and members of the
Order of Sydon in Mytros. Reading through the letters
reveals that Gaius is fanatical in his devotion to Sydon.
He believes that the Five must be stamped out and that
Sydon and his new pantheon will herald a golden age in
Thylea. He dreams of a time when the people of Thylea
can strike out into the rest of the world and conquer it.
Gaius also writes about his love for his dragon, Argyn.
He recently purchased a gift for her-a sapphire, her
favorite gemstone. She cannot take human form yet, and
she has been indifferent to most of his overtures.
Treasure. A small chest in the room contains 240 gp
and a brilliant blue sapphire worth 1,000 gp.
Letter to Sydon. Among the letters is one addressed
to the Lord of Storms himself. It reads:




Divine Sydon, Lord of All-
We have received thy orders, and we seek to execute
them faithfully. We are overjoyed to hear that thy fleets
have been readied for the invasion. Little time remains to
the accursed Oath, and the simpering masses of Mytros
will soon prostrate themselves at thy glorious feet, as is
right and proper.
We have but one concern, and that is the continued
presence of the horned mage, Lutheria's pet. He does not
participate in our daily sacrifices, and my men do not
trust him. Can he not be dismissed?

Prisoner: The Outsider
Mikhael (LG veteran) is the last survivor of an outsider
expedition that met its end in the Cerulean Gulf. He is
possibly the most valuable prisoner that the Order has
ever captured, because unlike other expeditions from
the outer world, Mikhael arrived in an airship. He and
his crew made it past the dangers of the Forgotten Sea,
but eventually, Sydon sent rocs to destroy the airship
and take its captain for interrogation.

it safely would be very difficult. The ten most valuable
books are worth 1,000 gp each.
Research. Spending 1d6 hours researching in the
library is the equivalent of asking the Oracle one question about Thylea. If you choose, the information gained
from research can be misleading and out of date, thanks
to the great age of many of the books and scrolls.

Y15. Sleeping Quarters

The bronze doors are covered in depictions of the
once-great Gygan Empire. The figures shown here are
engaged in reading, writing, and learned conversation.
Scrolls, quills, and bound books have been carved into
the surrounding stonework.

Y14. The Great Library

There are a half-dozen bunk beds in this room. This is
where the scholars sleep.
Enigma's Spellbook. Enigma's spellbook is lying open
on one of the desks here. Use the mage spell list.





The walls of this enormous room are lined with shelves
of books and scrolls that almost reach its staggeringly
high ceiling. A number of ladders also lean against
the walls, allowing access to even the highest tomes.
Six robed humans are busy studying and cleaning the
library's contents while two gygans stand guard.




This room contains the greatest collection of knowledge
in all of Thylea. There are thousands of scrolls and hundreds of books that detail everything from history, religion,
poetry, heroic epics, geology, medicine, etc. There is also a
section devoted to magical knowledge including the nature
of magic, famous magicians, planar lore, and other topics.
Six scholars (LE acolytes) tend to the books in this
vast library during the day. Two gygans guard the
library at all times.

The Great Library contains several volumes about the dragons that disappeared at the end of the First War. Balmytria
is known to be dead, because her body is interred in her
tomb at Telamok. The other four dragons were last seen in
the vicinity of The Golden Heart. One book speculates that
the dragons were captured by the Titans, but Chondrus
has written notes in the margin suggesting that he knows
this to be false. He believes that they were not captured
but rather transformed into something else.



Y16. Laboratory


Stone tables take up most of this room. They are covered in glassware of various sizes and shapes, arcane
tools, and strange artifacts. Two humans are at one
table, where they are intently mixing ingredients into
beakers. Two others sit on the stone floor with their
eyes closed. One of the shelves is filled with glass vials
that contain rows of colorful liquids.



The Missing Dragons



You enter a room containing six bunk beds. These quarters are tidier and more comfortable than the soldiers'
barracks, with desks and shelves of books.





This chamber is where the acolytes spend their time
in magical studies, gathering knowledge by contacting
other planes. Chondrus has ordered them to work day
and night, in rotating shifts.
There are two acolytes in deep meditation. They are
oblivious to their surroundings unless they are shaken
by someone. The two standing acolytes are mixing
alchemical concoctions. They are so intent on their
work that they will ignore anyone who enters the room
for at least 1d6 rounds, unless they are interrupted.
Treasure. There are many potions in this room. The
shelf contains two potions of clairvoyance, a potion of
mind reading, a potion of superior healing, a potion of
longevity and a potion of heroism.

Y17. Chondrus's Apartments
Treasure
The library contains a wealth of books and information
that the heroes may find useful.
Mythology. Every myth except for the Game of the
Gods can be found and read here. Refer to the Secrets
and Myths appendix for details.
Valuable Books. The entire collection of books in
the library is worth around 100,000 gp, but transporting

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf





These lavish quarters are a stark contrast to the austere
furnishings found throughout the rest of the library
complex. The room has silk curtains, ornate rugs, and
chairs and tables carved from fine wood. A gilded chest
sits by a large four-poster bed. A bronze bowl stands
atop a pillar of stone at the center of the room.




Chondrus (see appendix) is the arcane master who
runs the great library. As a high priest of Lutheria, he is
viewed with suspicion by the soldiers and gygans, but
Gaius has commanded them to follow the mage's orders.
Servant of Lutheria. Chondrus was once a part of
Lutheria's personal harem in Hypnos. She grew bored of
him and cast him out. Now, he seeks any way back into
her good graces. In desperation, he has contacted one of
the denizens of Hades, forming a pact with a powerful
arcanoloth. The arcanoloth has provided Chondrus with
magical secrets and information about the heroes. He
surrenders most of this knowledge to Sydon, but he has
kept some of it for his own purposes.
Confronting Chondrus
Unless Chondrus has been alerted, he can always be
found here communing with the arcanoloth, using the
bronze bowl in the middle of the room. His mezzoloth
servant stands in a corner, awaiting instructions.
Chondrus wields a dagger of defense. If he is alerted
to the presence of intruders, he will cast the invisibility
spell on himself and then lead the mezzoloth to search
for the heroes. His goal is to speak with them first.
Chondrus's Bargain. Chondrus realizes that nothing will win him more favor than delivering the heroes
directly to Lutheria. He will offer to join the party
and lead them to Hypnos, where he will plead their
case before the Lady of Dreams. In truth, he will do
everything possible to sabotage them in the Nether Sea
and deliver them to Lutheria helpless.
Epic Paths: The Dragonslayer
If the Dragonslayer is in the party, then Chondrus carries
the hero's greater artifact. In this case, he will offer the
item as part of his bargain.

The Bowl and the Missing Gear
The Bronze Bowl. If the heroes look into the bowl,
they will see the sly face of the arcanoloth staring back
at them. It will communicate with them telepathically
and try to convince the heroes to make a deal with it.
It offers extensive information about the Nether Sea in
exchange for an oath of service.
The Gilded Chest. The gilded chest in this room
holds the missing gear to the Antikythera device. It
is carefully wrapped in a white cloth. The chest also
contains Chondrus's spellbook, along with three rings
worth 250 gp each and 450 pp in coin.
The Antikythera's Missing Gear
The missing gear to the Antikythera device is required for
the heroes to navigate the Forgotten Sea. It's very important that the heroes don't miss this item.

Letter to Lutheria. On his desk, Chondrus has written a letter to Lutheria in Infernal. It reads:




Divine Lutheria, Mistress of Death-
The demon in the bowl has told me much about the
creatures imprisoned in the cubes of the Nether Sea. This
knowledge will be useful to thee, I am certain.
Seeking always to satisfy thy desire, I have faithfully
rendered seven years of service to thy insipid husband and
his sycophantic followers. What more must I do to once
again earn my place at thy rapturous feet?
-Thy eternal servant, Chondrus




Y18. Sacrificial Altar




A large stone altar sits out in the open. Piles of ashes
and charred wood sit atop the altar.

This is where offerings are given to Sydon. Searching
through the charred wood and ashes will reveal animal
bones mixed in with a few human bones.

Island of Themis
Themis is the largest island in the Cerulean Gulf and
consists of relatively flat grassland with small copses
of trees. There is one deep, safe bay on the western
edge of the island that is an ideal anchorage. Another
deep bay on the eastern edge of the island is too
dangerous for ships to enter due to jagged rocks that
break the surface.


Amazon Lifemates
Amazonian lifemates fight side-by-side with deadly
coordination. In the event that an Amazon witnesses the
death of her lifemate, she will enter a berserk state where
she gains advantage on all melee attacks. Enemies gain
advantage on attacks made against her in this state.


Your ship nears a large isle made up of flat grassland
only occasionally broken by small copses. From your
ship, you can see a herd of strange, speckled creatures
similar in appearance to horses but with ridiculously
long necks that can reach to the top of tall trees.


Themis has different fauna from the rest of Thylea,
including tropical animals such as antelopes, giraffes,
lions, hyenas, and rhinoceroses. Tales of these creatures
are told far and wide, but what truly makes the island
famous are its legendary denizens: the Amazons.
Island Handout: Themis
When the party arrives at Themis, give your players a
copy of the Island of Themis map.

Queen Thesilea



The Amazons of Themis are currently led by Queen
Thesilea VI, the sixth of her name and "first amongst
equals." Despite this title, Thesilea VI and her two
sisters rule the Amazons with absolute power, backed
by the authority of Lutheria. There has been no equality
among the Amazons for over a decade.
The three sisters wear sacred platinum helmets that
signify obedience to Lutheria and elevate them above
the rest of the sisterhood. The helmets also conceal a
dangerous truth: Thesilea and her sisters are actually
medusae who murdered the previous queen thirteen
years ago and replaced her. None of the other Amazons
on the island suspect this terrifying truth, and few
would believe it without damning evidence.

Death Cult of Lutheria

THE AMAZONS

Centuries ago, the Amazons of Themis were counted
among the diverse warrior-tribes of Indigo Island. But
during the First War, their forces were entirely shattered
by the armies of the Titans. Blaming their losses on the
frailty of the men who surrounded them, they sought to
isolate themselves from the rest of Thylea and create a
stronger society: a society dominated by female warriors. Accordingly, they retreated to the remote island of
Themis and established an isolated kingdom, unspoiled
by the weakness of men.
The Amazons are as racially diverse as the tribes
of Indigo Island, including elves, dwarves, gnomes,
and even native races such as sirens and minotaurs.
The Amazons define themselves as a sacred band of
warriors who always stand together as a sisterhood.
They train for combat from an early age, and once they
come of age, they form into pairs of sister-warriors:
lifemates.
There are only a few thousand Amazons on Themis,
but they are among the most feared warriors in all of
Thylea-brutal berserkers with no mercy. They have
been known to take prisoners for breeding purposes,
but most of them are executed.

When the imposter queen came to power thirteen
years ago, she converted all the shrines on the island
and enforced the worship of Lutheria. There was initial
resistance to this change, but it was soon quashed by
a campaign of fear and public execution. Those who
survived are grudgingly loyal to the throne.
Some of Lutheria's servants dwell among the Amazons
to watch over them and ensure their loyalty. There is
a small band of maenads who rove across the island,
accompanied by their children (goatlings) and some
leering men (cultists). These are the only surviving men
on the island who are older than eighteen. Every night,
the band celebrates with a wild bacchanal that includes
drinking and sometimes bloodshed.

Creatures of Themis
The Amazons have domesticated some of the beasts on
Themis. They use rhinoceroses as mounts, and they
have trained the native basilisks to act as hounds. Most
Amazon warriors keep clockwork birds, called stimfay,
as loyal companions and scouts.

Encounter: Maenads

Men of Themis

If the heroes travel by night, they may encounter the
roving band of maenads.

Men are tolerated on the island only for the purposes of
procreation-they have no voice in civic affairs or in the
raising of children. Amazons disdain men as a rule, but
there are some who have a sympathetic opinion of the
weaker sex. Such women might love a man the way they
love a faithful dog-anything more would be taboo.
Men who are captured on the island may be thrown
into prison and evaluated for suitability as breeding
stock. Queen Thesilea keeps a small selection of young
men for this purpose at an underwater temple on a
small island off the coast of Themis. These men have
been raised since they were children to believe that they
are the favored sons of Lutheria. But on their eighteenth
birthdays, they are escorted out of the temple and
turned to stone.





The Amazons don't build any permanent structures on
the island except for their prison. Instead, they travel
across the island and make temporary camps, usually of
10-20 Amazons and rhino mounts. Each camp is prepared for surprise raids and skirmishes with the other
camps. This perpetual "great game of war" is considered
essential to the Amazonian way of life.

Event: Amazon War Party

ENCOUNTERS

Once the Amazons know that there are outsiders on
Themis, they will dispatch a war band to capture them.

Encounter: Amazon hunting party



When the heroes first arrive on the island, they may
encounter a group of Amazons and basilisk "hounds"
hunting antelope.

Unless the heroes are all women, the four Amazon
warriors will attack on sight, declaring the party to be
trespassers and spies. Each of the Amazons is mounted
on a rhinoceros, and they will be aided in the fight by
the four basilisks. If the heroes are all women, then the
Amazons will surround them and insist that they must
be taken to their queen, Thesilea.

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf



You hear something rush over your head, carried on
a strong gust of wind. Six fierce-looking women hang
from mechanical birds that rapidly glide towards your
party. Once close to the ground, the women drop
down, tumble, and stand before you with their weapons drawn. The avian constructs wheel and continue
their descent towards your party.



A small herd of delicate antelope crosses your path.
Four suddenly stop. One looks back and immediately
turns to stone. The reason for its petrification quickly
becomes apparent as four eight-legged reptiles the
size of bulls burst into view. The creatures have been
fitted with harnesses that are held by a group of
athletic women riding strange beasts not far behind.
The mounts are just as strange as the hounds: they
are large, hairless animals with leathery gray hides and
horns protruding from their snouts.




The band consists of six maenads, a dozen goatlings,
and five leering men (NE cultists). They are all drunk
and engaged in fornication, drinking, gambling, dancing, and singing. If the heroes investigate, the men invite
them to join the party. They explain that this land is now
the domain of Lutheria, the Lady of Dreams, but the
Amazons are too proud to join their celebrations.
The maenads will attack the heroes if they refuse to
join in the revelry. The cultists have the poisoned condition due to their inebriated state.

War Camps and Skirmishes





Wild music, celebratory shouting, and primal grunting
fill the night air. You stumble into a hedonistic scene lit
by firelight. Some revelers dance and sing, while others
throw dice on the ground. By far the largest contingent
is the tangle of bodies rutting in the grass.
The group consists of six horned women, a dozen
creatures with the legs of goats, and five adult human
men. Though all of them appear to be drunk, the men
are particularly slow and awkward.





The six Amazon warriors drop down to attack the
heroes while their stimfay attack from the air. The
Amazon warriors are all lifemated pairs: when one of
them dies, their lifemate enters a berserker frenzy.
If the heroes are captured, they will be stripped of
their gear and taken to The Prisons (P7) in the Sacred
Temple. Once there, they will be imprisoned and later
questioned by Leah, one of Queen Thesilea's sisters.

THE SACRED TEMPLE

The sacred temple of the Amazons is located on an
island in an eastern bay of Themis. This well-defended
complex is constructed entirely underground, and it
doubles as both a prison and a place of worship. The
Amazons who guard this temple are those who were



cruel and self-interested enough to embrace the worship
of Lutheria when Queen Thesilea came to power. They
scorn the rest of the Amazons as weaklings.
The main entrance to the temple is on the small rocky
outcrop of the island, above the high tide line. There are
two secret entrances located underwater which can be
used by someone who is willing to confront a hydra or
squeeze through a pipe. All of the Amazons know of the
two underwater entrances. The only way for the party to
learn about them is to interrogate one of the Amazons
that they encounter on the island.

The bronze doors are unlocked. This area is under guard
at all times by two Amazon warriors who will fight to
the death. They are lifemates, and if one dies, the other
goes into a berserker frenzy. If a fight breaks out, it may
be heard by Nura in the Basilisk Pens (P3), and she will
release her creatures to join the fight.

P3. Basilisk Pens


Ceilings
The ceilings throughout the temple are 10 feet high
unless otherwise noted.

Illumination
All of the rooms and hallways have a single brazier
hanging from the ceiling with a continual flame spell
providing light.



KEY LOCATIONS
P1. Island of Statues




A forest of life-sized human statues stands on the
island. The vast majority of these marble statues are
beautiful, naked young men. A handful are different,
belonging to one of two distinct groups. The first set
is a motley assortment of fit but average-looking men
of all ages. Some of these are engraved with tattoos or
scars, while others are missing one or more limbs.


This is a stable for the basilisks that the Amazons raise
as hounds. The pieces of rubble are taken from the statues outside and broken up into food for the basilisks.
There are four basilisks in the pens. Nura, a dwarven
Amazon warrior, acts as their keeper. She has raised
basilisks all of her life and loves the creatures more than
she loves any of her sisters. She enters a berserker frenzy
when one of them dies, as if it were her lifemate.
Nura will release the basilisks if she hears any combat
occurring in the Entry Chamber (P2). It takes her two
rounds to unlock the cages and come to the aid of her
embattled sisters.





You continue into the underground complex by way of
a well-constructed tunnel. A honeycomb-like structure
of large holes runs along one of the tunnel's walls.
Occasional splashing and dripping noises reverberate
from these smaller tunnels. The atmosphere is humid
and smells of stagnant water.

By order of Queen Thesilea, when an Amazon male
reaches the age of 18, he is brought here and turned to
stone. These are the young male statues. Mixed in with
the hundreds of youthful males are older men, most of
whom were unfortunate sailors who had the bad luck to
shipwreck on Themis.
Guardian Golems. At the very center of the island is
a grand marble staircase that leads down to the prison
of the Amazons. The four statues at the entrance are
not petrified men but four marble golems, gifts to the
Amazonian queen from Lutheria. These golems will
attack anyone who is not an Amazon woman.



P2. Entry Chamber


The entrance to the underground complex beyond
is barred by a set of imposing bronze doors. Two
women sit at a table in front of the great doors. Both
are armed with swords and bows.




P4. Hydra Tunnels






This chamber has a set of pens constructed from
bronze, each able to hold an animal the size of a large
horse. Piles of white stone rubble lie just outside each
pen. Many of the shattered pieces are in the shapes
of human limbs and faces. The pens hold eight-legged
reptiles, and one of them makes a contented rumbling
noise as a stocky, muscular woman scratches the
underside of its chin.





The holes along the wall lead to the Hydra Lair (P5).
Small creatures, such as halflings, can crawl into the
holes, which are 2 ft. wide, and traverse the tunnels.
Hydra Trap. The hydra in the adjacent chamber uses
the holes to attack anyone who tries to traverse this
hallway without saying the proper command words. The
command words are "By the Grace of Lutheria." Every
Amazon in the temple complex knows these words.
Portcullis Trap. There is a trap trigger plate at the
center of the hall that releases three portcullises if
someone steps on it. The trigger plate can be spotted
with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check.
When activated, the portcullises will trap anyone in

Strength of 30. The trap can be reset by pulling a lever in
the Amazon Barracks (P6).

stomach. If the hydra is cut open, there are two emerald
rings worth 1,000 gp each and a star sapphire medallion
worth 2,500 gp. The legendary sword, Titansbane, can
also be found within the hydra's stomach.

Hydra Heads

P6. Amazon Barracks

The Amazons have transformed this hydra into a monstrous and powerful guardian. A hydra can have a practical maximum of thirteen heads; beyond that count the
heads start to become more of a hindrance than a help,
and a hydra with more than thirteen heads will eat the
extra heads when it gets hungry.
Each extra head after the fifth one adds 10 HP to a
hydra's hit point total to a maximum of 252 HP. When
a hydra gains more than thirteen heads, it stops gaining extra hit points and becomes unbalanced. The 14+
headed hydra's heads have disadvantage on their attacks.
For each head after the thirteenth, the hydra's walk and
swim speed are reduced by 5 feet. A hydra with 19 heads
is therefore completely immobile.
The hydra in the Sacred Temple has ten heads (222
HP). The hydra is able to attack each 5 ft. square of the
hallway with two of its heads. If it is reduced to less than
five heads, it will retreat back to its lair.





Treasure
There are six chests in the room. They contain the personal possessions of the guards: each has an adamantine
dagger, 10d4 pp, and 1d6 gems (50 gp per gem).

P7. The Prisons


This cavern is the lair of a hydra. There is a bronze circular portal set into the floor that leads to the Temple of
Lutheria (P11). The pool of water gives the hydra access
to the outside, where it goes fishing when hungry. The
ceiling in this cavern is 20 feet high.
The Monstrous Gift. This hydra was a gift from
Lutheria to Queen Thesilea. She and her sister have
modified the hydra by cutting its heads off and allowing
more to regrow. While the Amazons have trained the
hydra to not attack the hallway when the correct words
are spoken, the monstrosity will always attack anyone
who enters its lair. It remembers its suffering at the
hands of the Amazons and is still angry.
Treasure
The hydra messily devours anyone who enters its lair,
and many of its victims' items are still lodged within its

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf





You come to a hallway lined with locked prison doors
of heavy oak. The only view of the cramped quarters
beyond is a small barred window in the center each
door. Two of the cells are occupied by lizardfolk, who
scratch at the door and plead with you in hissing
voices. The last cell houses a young woman with a scar
across her face. She is strangely quiet.

A large reptilian creature paces in the cave's center.
Ten heads sprout from narrow snakelike necks, snapping occasionally at each other. The creature moves
unsteadily on its four limbs, which seem a little inadequate for the task of propelling its own awkwardly
distributed weight.
An array of identical two-foot-wide holes have been
bored into the cavern's north wall. To the south, a pool
laps against the rocky subterranean shore.




This is where the temple guards sleep and eat. There are
usually two Amazon warriors here-cruel prison wardens who spend their time playing dice. There is a lever
on the north wall that can be used to raise and lower the
portcullises in the hallway outside (P4).

P5. Hydra Lair




Sets of bunk beds line the walls of this modest room.
Aside from the wooden chests that rest at the foot
of each bunk, the only other furniture of note is a
large circular table with a set of matching chairs
around it.





This prison houses anyone who is captured by the
Amazons. Currently, there are two lizardfolk who
were captured in a recent raid on Fire Island. These
lizardfolk are loyal to Vytha, the deposed lizard queen,
and they will work with any potential rescuers to
escape. They promise great rewards for the heroes if
they agree to rescue Bront, the jancan from the Forge
Room (P13), and bring him back to Fire Island to serve
their queen.
Darien, The Silent Prisoner
One of the cells holds Darien (NG Amazon warrior) who seems to be incapable of speaking. This
is because her prison cell has been permanently
enchanted with the silence spell. She is visited once
every few days by her loyal stimfay, who brings her
news of the outside world, including exciting tales of
the party's exploits.
Darien is the rightful heir to the throne of the
Amazons, but she has been captive here for thirteen

years-ever since she was five years old. Thesilea
murdered her mother, the former queen, but not
before swearing an oath that she would allow Darien to
come of age unharmed. Accordingly, the girl was kept
silent and out of sight, while an imposter assumed the
throne.
The Rightful Queen. If the heroes release Darien
from her cell, then she begins to speak, haltingly. She
explains that the Amazons have been corrupted by
Lutheria. Thesilea and her sisters were once trusted
advisors to the throne-until something changed. They
cornered Darien's mother in her chambers and revealed
themselves to be inhuman monsters with snakes for hair.
They had been transformed into medusae and granted
dark powers by the Lady of Dreams.
The truth about Queen Thesilea is a secret known
only to Darien. She is eager to join with the heroes and
exact revenge upon the monsters who killed her mother.
She has spent her entire life training in her cell so that
she can one day reclaim the throne and banish all worship of Lutheria from Themis, restoring the Amazons to
a sisterhood of equals.

Darien the
Silent Prisoner

P8. The Stockroom




The walls of this room are lined with bunk beds. Fine
rugs line the floor and its residents-four unarmed
men-recline in chairs cushioned with velvet pillows.
The young men appear to be angry and confused at
your sudden intrusion into their reverie.




This is where the breeding stock of men are kept until
they come of age. There are usually four young men
in the room (CN commoners), with the rest in the
Breeding Chambers (P10). They have been raised since
birth to be absolutely loyal to the Amazons. They will
not attack intruders, but they won't help them either.
If given a chance, the men will try to raise the alarm.
Attempts to convince them of their cruel situation
will fall upon deaf ears. They believe that they are the
blessed sons of Lutheria and that they will become
immortal when they are transformed into stone.
The heroes can shatter the beliefs of one of the men
with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
He will not be of much help, however, as his knowledge
is limited to the rooms on this level.

P9. Hall of Honors




This finely-appointed room stands empty except for
several bunk beds and a table. Lining the walls are
dozens of commemorative bronze medallions. Hanging
along the back wall is a large scroll with writing on it.




This chamber is used by the Amazons to reward the
victors of the great game of war that is played out across
the island each year. It is currently empty. The scroll on
the back wall bears the ancient code of the Amazons.
A SISTERHOOD OF EQUALS,
OUR STRENGTH FORGED IN BATTLE.
DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR!

P10. Breeding Chambers




The centerpieces of this luxurious room are its two
large beds, which are equipped with soft silks and pillows in vibrant shades of red. In one bed, two women
and three young men lie contorted around each other
in ecstasy. In the other bed, two scrawny goat-like
creatures perform acts that are slightly more profane.




This is where Thesilea's favored warriors breed with
their male stock. It is usually done in a religious fervor,
aided by the consumption of the Madon fungus. Usually
there are two Amazon warriors and three men (CN
commoners) in the room. In addition, there are two
goatling tricksters here enjoying themselves. None of
them have weapons, and they will only attack if they are
disturbed.

P11. Temple of Lutheria


Treasure. There is a small bronze chest under the
bed. Inside is a sending stone. The other stone is in
the possession of Moxena, the Lady of Coins from the
Colossus of Pythor (C6). Moxena is the sister of Leah and
Thesilea, but she has been away from Themis for more
than a decade. The chest also contains 100 gp and 75 pp,
and the key to Bront's shackles.

P13. Forge Room


Cushions and chairs line the walls of this great, highceilinged, oblong room. At the opposite end of the
chamber stands a white marble statue of a horned
woman wielding a crystal scythe. The woman's eyes are
inlaid with black onyx, and her unearthly gaze seems to
follow you around the room.




This is not only a place of worship, but also where
Amazons are taken to give birth.
Statue of Lutheria. Anyone who touches the statue
must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure,
they are rendered catatonic for 1 hour, during which
they experience horrifying visions of the Nether Sea.



P12. The Queen's Chambers




These living quarters have been furnished by someone
with an eye for beauty and luxury. A woman and a
young man are making love on the room's only bed.
Although otherwise completely naked, the woman is
still wearing the platinum helmet that symbolizes her
station as a ruler of the Amazons. A horned woman
serenades the couple with her pan flute, though her
music does little to silence the infant cries coming
from a cradle at the corner of the room.




This grand room is flanked by two elements: along
one wall, fires blaze within a massive forge; along the
opposite wall there is a pool of cold, clear water. An
anvil stands halfway between the two walls, and a pile
of bronze rubbish next to it reflects the light of the fire.
Upon closer inspection, the heap of bronze is half-finished mechanical birds the size of men. The room's
only occupant is a male cyclops with strange hands. He
has ten fingers on each! One of his legs is chained to a
ring in the floor.





This is where the blacksmith, Bront (TN jancan), forges
weapons, armor and other constructs for the Amazons.
He is a prisoner here, having been captured during a
raid upon Fire Island. His ankle is shackled to the floor
by adamantine chain links. He has enough chain to
move about the room, but no more. The key to this
chain is held by Leah, the medusa, among her treasures.
Bront is scared and lonely. He wants to talk to anyone
who enters. Most of all, he wants to escape and return to
Fire Island, where he served Jankor, the lizardfolk king.
He might have been heartless and demanding, but he
was fair and treated him with a degree of respect.
If the heroes ask about the whereabouts of
Titansbane, the legendary sword, he will explain that
Thesilea grew annoyed with it and fed it to the hydra.



The doors to this room are always locked, as the chamber
is used by Queen Thesilea or her sisters when they are
visiting the temple. The lock requires a DC 15 Dexterity
check with thieves' tools to open.
Leah (CE medusa) is currently here, although she is
preoccupied by the company of one of the men from
the Stockroom (P8), while a maenad plays music for the
lovers. The cradle in a corner of the room holds two
goatling tricksters disguised as human infants.
Leah is the honored sister of Queen Thesilea. She will
not immediately remove her helmet in a fight. She will
wait until more than one of the heroes has engaged in
melee with her before doing so, to maximize the shock
value of her true powers. The young man will cower
beneath the sheets and avoid battle.

The Son of Bront
If Steros the Jancan is present with the party, he will
expect and then demand that his father be rescued. Bront
will be surprised to see Steros, as the last time the two of
them spoke was at Praxys. Bront was previously unaware
that his son replaced him on Fire Island.

Treasure
Hanging on the wall is a shield +1 with the symbol of
Lutheria is emblazoned upon it. The shield is a present
intended for Queen Thesilea at her next birthday.
There are several other finely-crafted weapons and
pieces of armor hanging on the walls, including two adamantine shortswords, an adamantine breastplate, and a
coat of mithral chain mail.

P14. Cooling Pipe

The Queen's War Party

This pipe feeds water into the pool in the Forge Room
(P13). Bront uses the water to quench heated metal that
he's working. The pipe is large enough for a Mediumsized creature (or smaller) to swim through.

If the heroes raid the Sacred Temple and escape, Queen
Thesilea will ride out and confront them when they try
to make their way back to their ship.


CONFRONTING
QUEEN THESILEA

There are two ways for the heroes to encounter and
confront Queen Thesilea. They may encounter her in
the Sacred Temple complex, or they may encounter her
on the way back to their ship.
Moxena's Secret Plot
If Moxena, the Lady of Coins, is present during this part
of the adventure, she will actively seek revenge upon
her sister, Thesilea. She will demand to accompany the
heroes when they land on Themis, and she will use disguise self to appear human until her goals are achieved.
When she meets Thesilea or Leah, she will start a
battle no matter what the heroes desire. Once her
sisters have been killed, Moxena will seize control of the
Sacred Temple and declare herself the new Queen of the
Amazons. Depending upon how the party has treated her,
she may allow the heroes to leave in peace.
If the party has been respectful towards Moxena, then
she will reward each hero with 500 gp in precious gemstones. However, if they have been disrespectful, then
she will order them all killed.
Moxena will do everything possible to undermine
Darien, who is the rightful queen. She wants only to
reclaim the power and position that her sisters denied
her. She has no interest in the Amazon code.

Inside the Temple
Within the Temple complex Queen Thesilea (NE
medusa) is always accompanied by her personal guard,
five fanatical Amazon warriors who are as cruel as she
is. They are willing to die for their queen, even if her
true nature is revealed. They go berserk if she is killed.
If Leah is still alive when the heroes meet Thesilea,
then she will immediately join the battle alongside her
sister. She and her sister will reveal their true natures
during the battle, in order to make use of their powers.
If the heroes are fighting alongside Darien, Thesilea's
guards consider her to be no more than an escaped
prisoner. Darien cannot claim the throne until Thesilea
has been defeated in battle. Moreover, Darien came of
age several months ago, so Thesilea is no longer oathbound-she is free to order Darien's execution.

178

Ch apter 5 - The Cerule a n Gulf



As you make your way across the island, a thunder of
animals can be heard in the distance, growing louder
over time. Soon, you make out the figures of six
female warriors riding towards you on stocky, horned
creatures. Each looks your way and begins nocking an
arrow. Their leader, a particularly regal figure, wears
a platinum helmet. In the sky above, six more warrior
women hang from large clockwork birds, which fly in
your direction.




The queen and her five riders (Amazon warriors) will
keep their distance and attack with bows. Six additional
Amazon warriors arrive with their stimfay, dropping
down to attack the heroes in close combat. The queen
and her warriors fight to the death.

The Death of the Queen
Once Thesilea and her sister have been killed, Amazon
tribes from across the island will arrive at the Sacred
Temple to arrest the remaining forces who were loyal to
the medusae. They grudgingly thank the heroes for their
assistance (preferring female heroes if possible).
At this point, the heroes may recommend Darien or
Moxena as the new queen, if either of them are present. Alternatively, if one of the heroes is an Amazonian
woman, they may claim the throne for themselves.
The Rightful Queen
Once Thesilea has been dealt with, the heroes may
present Darien as the rightful queen of the Amazons. She
can secure her claim by reciting a secret royal phrase in
the Temple of Lutheria (P11), which causes the statue of
Lutheria to crumble into dust.

The Queen's Treasure
Queen Thesilea carries a golden, gem-studded holy
symbol of Lutheria worth 1,000 gp. The platinum helmets worn by Thesilea and her sisters are worth 800 gp
each, but they are relics that have belonged to the true
queens of the Amazons for centuries.
Epic Paths: The Amazon Queen
If the Haunted One is in the party, then Queen Thesilea
also carries the greater family artifact that they seek.
Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

Chapter 6:

The Forgotten Sea
"The Forgotten Sea comprises thousands of
miles of ocean churned by storms, whirlpools, and
elemental magic. The waters are home to massive creatures, cyclopean ruins, and the tower of
the ocean god himself. You cannot conquer the
Forgotten Sea-you can only survive it."

T

-Vallus, Goddess of Wisdom

he Forgotten Sea is the endless expanse
of ocean that stretches beyond the Cerulean
Gulf. This is the indisputable domain of Sydon,
the Lord of Storms. The sailors of Mytros and
Aresia know better than to cross through the narrow
straits of the Barrier Islands, because the Titan does not
suffer trespassers to live. Death awaits any mortal who
ventures into the territory of the ocean god.
There are hundreds of islands in the Forgotten Sea.
This chapter details those that are most significant to
the story of this book, but just about any adventure set
on a remote island could take place here. Feel free to
include encounters that would be unusual in the rest
of Thylea. Sydon may have recruited powerful outside
forces into his armies-or perhaps his storms have
simply shipwrecked them here.

Running the Adventure
The party's primary goal in the Forgotten Sea is to find
and confront the Titans. Sydon can be found in his
tower at Praxys, but Kyrah recommends confronting
Lutheria first. Both Titans are extremely dangerous, but
Sydon is protected by an entire army.
Lutheria can be found by seeking out an entrance to
the Nether Sea, but Kyrah doesn't know where to find
one. The party should eventually stumble into the massive whirlpool, Charybdis, which will take them there.

Dangerous Waters
Sailing the Forgotten Sea should feel more dangerous
than the Cerulean Gulf. Storms and encounters are
more frequent here, and the ocean is always rough,
pushing the crew of the Ultros to its limits.




As you sail into the Forgotten Sea, dark storm clouds
spread across the horizon and powerful waves crash
against the hull of your ship. Saltwater frequently rains
down upon the deck, drenching the crew. You suddenly
realize that sailing through these angry waters will
someday be counted among your many Great Labors.

Aerie of the Roc




Your ship approaches an island dominated by a single
massive mountain surrounded by steep cliffs. The
island is ringed by coral reefs and jagged rocks. Any
attempts to navigate a large ship near this island's
rocky shores are likely to end in disaster.


This mountainous island soars 500 ft. into the air, has
no natural bays, and is surrounded by dangerous reefs
and rocky shallows. Approaching the island requires the
use of a rowboat. Navigating the rocks and reefs in the
rowboat requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival)
check. Magical transportation would also work.
The craggy island is the nesting place for a mated pair
of rocs who have produced a clutch of young-a once
per decade event. The rocs have been hunting aggressively to feed their voracious young. Normally, rocs
have enormous, world-spanning hunting grounds, but
this pair have confined themselves to the waters around
Thylea, in order to remain close to their nest. The rocs
are protective of their nest, making them more aggressive than they would typically be.

180

Ch apter 6 - The Forgotten Se a



Climbing to the Nest
There are no easy paths up to the rocs' nest. Climbing
requires three successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics)
checks. The party can make the climb easier by using
ropes and pitons. Falling from any height results in 30
(10d6) bludgeoning damage.
Other flying scavengers nest on the lower parts of the
island, eating whatever scraps that the rocs leave behind.
Amongst these scavengers are a half dozen perytons
nesting in a cave half way up the cliffs. The perytons are
hungry and thus very aggressive.

The Rocs' Nest




This massive nest is constructed from splintered tree
trunks and ship masts. The nest is splattered with
heaps of bird droppings, some of which seem to hide
salvage from destroyed ships. Six towering fledglings
with hooked beaks gaze at you hungrily.




Six fledgling rocs (use giant vulture statistics) live in
the nest. They won't leave the nest, but they will attack
anything that comes within pecking distance. Whenever
they reduce a target to zero hit points, they tear it apart
and devour it hungrily.
Treasure
Amid the droppings of the fledgling rocs are spoils from
the wreckage of many Thylean ships. Each hour spent

searching the nest turns up random treasure. Roll once
on the CR 5-10 treasure hoard table in the 5th Edition
Game Master's Guide for each hour. After three hours of
searching, everything has been discovered.
For each hour that the heroes spend searching, there
is a 20% cumulative chance of the two adult rocs returning to the nest (20% in the first hour, 40% in the second,
60% in the third).

The Garden of Helios




The island ahead is completely shrouded in fog. When
you sail close enough to properly see through this haze,
you find that rocky cliffs have formed a natural plateau,
elevating the island's landscape far above the water.
You can see shrubs and other plants spilling over the
top of the cliffs, and you hear the strange, trumpeting
calls of exotic beasts from farther inland.




This island is surrounded by enormous cliffs and perpetually surrounded by clouds and mist. There are a
couple of anchorages, but anyone landing faces a long
climb up to the island's plateau-like top.
Most of the island consists of shrubs and grasslands,
but there is a sizeable forest in the center. A cyclops clan
has lived here for many centuries, and around 100 of
the giants still live on the island. There are 80 male and
female adults with 20 young (use ogre statistics for the
young cyclopes). The cyclopes spend their lives raising
large herds of elephants as cattle.

The Sun God
The island is ruled by a radiant, golden-haired man
named Helios (NE polymorphed adult gold dragon),
hence its name. He claims to be the sun god who was
once revered by all the mortal and giant races of Thylea,
long before the coming of the Dragonlords.
False God
It's true that Helios was once revered as a sun god, but
he never possessed any true divine power. He is merely
a dragon who masquerades as a god by dazzling his
worshippers with his polymorphed form.
Helios came here as a wyrmling 600 years ago, blown
off course while flying between continents. He makes
infrequent visits to mainland Thylea, mostly to check on
various ancient shrines that were constructed to honor
him, centuries ago. He is still revered by many small
tribes of native creatures, including cyclopes, nymphs,
centaurs, and satyrs.

Paranoid Dragon
Helios is suspicious of anyone who comes to his island.
Sydon warned him long ago that Thyleans would send
heroes to kill and flay him for his beautiful golden skin.
There is, indeed, an almost forgotten legend that the
skin of "the Sun God" grants immortality to any who
wear it, and one of the Ultros' crew will mention it if
Helios is discussed when the heroes are aboard.
In spite of his understandably suspicious nature,
Helios is always pleased by the prospect of visitors. The
company of cyclopes leaves much to be desired as they
are crude, often violent folk. Helios also seeks knowledge about current events in Thylea. He will not reveal
his dragon form to visitors until he has decided whether
or not to devour them, or they directly attack him. The
heroes will be on the menu if he decides they represent a
threat to his domain, or to Sydon.

The Cyclops Army
Centuries ago, Helios swore an oath of service to Sydon
in order to protect his island. He has been training his
cyclopes to wear armor and to wield mauls, in preparation for the Titan's forthcoming battle against the
mortals of Thylea. However, Helios cares for his cyclopes as if they were his children, and he dislikes the idea
of sending them to war.
Cyclopean Ruins. The cyclopes live in ancient stone
buildings that were built by the gygans a thousand
years ago. The buildings are now partial ruins, as the
cyclopes have not taken care of them. The creatures
live simple, but contented, lives tending to their herds
and competing in games of strength.
When he's not training the cyclopes, Helios spends
his time on a small island just off the coast of the main
island. It is forested and rather beautiful. He lives in a
shallow lake at the center.
Armored Cyclopes
Each adult cyclops on the island has AC 16. Their multiattack action allows them to make two maul attacks.
Maul: Melee Weapon Attack, +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. Hit: 29 (6d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

The Feast
Helios awaits the party on the small island where he
makes his home. He takes his polymorphed form and
uses the full effect of his charm, his beauty, and his radiant golden jewelry to give the impression of a gracious
and generous "Sun God."

Helios the
Sun God





You arrive at the prepared feast, set on a pristine sandy
beach that borders a crystal-clear pool at the center of
the small island. An elderly cyclops with a milky white
eye sets out plates of enormous cuts of roasted meat
on the ornate dining table before you. Your host stands
at the opposite end of the table.
Helios is an incredibly handsome man, made more
splendid by radiant jewelry and skin that nearly glows
with divine vigor. Sunlight glints from his golden hair,
which matches the burnished color of his eyes.




As the feast begins, Helios dismisses his guards,
leaving only Tolyphemus, an elderly and blind cyclops,
to serve the main dish of elephant meat. Tolyphemus
serves as the sun god's chef and steward. He dislikes
mortals-human sailors blinded him years ago.
Helios politely converses with the heroes for a little
while. He asks about their heroic exploits and appears
duly impressed if they describe their deeds.
Epic Path: The Dragonslayer
Helios has long anticipated the arrival of the
Dragonslayer. He was told by the Fates that someone
from their family or village would one day kill him.
Consequently, he rained fire down upon their village,
but he could never confirm whether the Dragonslayer
survived. Now, he hopes to rectify his past failure. Refer
to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

Battling Helios
Eventually, Helios grows bored with the heroes (particularly if they are boastful and arrogant) and decides that
they are to become the next course in his meal.

The Invitation



Helios sends a band of six cyclopes to greet visitors and
bring them into his presence. The cyclopes are quite
stupid, but they have been ordered to be gracious and
accommodating with guests. They speak of their master
with open reverence and invite the heroes to a feast:




"Great Sun God Helios welcome you to island. He send
warm greetings and invite you to feast! Thanks be to
Great Sun God. He is kind and generous master!"


182

Ch apter 6 - The Forgotten Se a





Helios sighs heavily and stretches his arms.
"You seemed like such interesting guests, but this
party has grown dreadfully tedious. Fortunately, such
accomplished heroes as yourselves should make for a
truly delectable dessert."
As he speaks, Helios begins to transform. Claws
grow from his hands, and his teeth multiply, spreading
into a broad, draconic grin. He towers over you now, a
massive dragon with lustrous golden scales.




Anger of the Furies
Since Helios has broken the law of guest friendship by
deciding to eat the heroes, he is subject to the curse of
the treacherous. If the battle starts to go very badly for
the heroes, you can choose to have an erinyes show
up to try and capture Helios. The erinyes will fly out of
the sky and begin to rain arrows down upon the gold
dragon. If this happens, read the following:


Treasure of the Sun God
Helios's lair contains a massive hoard of 40,000 gp in
coins and precious jewels. The pride and joy of his
hoard is a beautiful golden chariot of dawn. Helios once
used this chariot to fly around Thylea, inspiring awe in
the primitive mortals who lived on the continent before
the coming of the Dragonlords. This was the origin of
his claim to be the Sun God.


A piercing scream from the sky interrupts the battle.
A woman dressed in heavy black armor, borne aloft by
a pair of red feathered wings, swoops towards Helios.
Her face is contorted in unbridled rage as she strikes at
the dragon with her longsword!


When Helios is reduced to 50 hit points or less, he
transforms back into his human form and begs for
forgiveness. The erinyes will ignore his pleas and use
her rope of entanglement to restrain him. She will then
teleport away with Helios to the Island of Oathbreakers
in the Nether Sea (N5). If the heroes haven't visited the
Island of Oathbreakers, you might want to make a note
that Helios is imprisoned there for when they do visit.

Epic Path: The Gifted One
The Gifted One discovers the instant fortress in this treasure hoard. This is the Fortress of the Dragonlords. Refer
to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

Island of the Dragon




You approach what appears to be a tropical paradise,
an island surrounded by calm, clear waters with pink
sandy beaches that make for easy landfalls. A mountain
stands above the dense jungle at the island's center,
and many idyllic waterfalls cascade down from this
impressive central rock formation.




This island has several lagoons that make excellent
harbors, as well as beautiful inlets where a ship can be
beached. It is easy to make landing at almost any spot on
the island's coastline.
Hexia, an adult green dragon, lives here. Her foul
influence has leached into the landscape, causing the
jungles to grow unnaturally thick with trees, vines, and
underbrush. After landing at the beach, it's difficult to
move through the interior of the island.
All of the animal life on the island, large and small, act
as Hexia's eyes and ears. Like a jealous goddess, she is
aware of everything that happens on her island, which
serves as her personal hunting ground. She eats the deer
and boar that thrive in the jungles, but each month on
the full moon, she goes hunting for sweeter meat.
Hexia's Secret History
Hexia has lived in Thylea for over five centuries. She
is the adopted sister of Kyrah, Pythor, and Vallus, and
was raised by the dragons Volkan and Balmytria. Hexia's
mother, an ancient green, had been terrorizing some
long-forgotten country in the Old World, and the
Dragonlords slew her. Volkan took her under his wing,
quite literally.
Hexia always sought Pythor's affections, and the two
of them were eventually married. It did not work out. She
never forgave him for giving up his dragon form when he
became the God of Battle. She became intensely jealous
of his many consorts, seeing them as rivals for the love
that should rightly be hers.
This bitterness has eaten away all the goodness
that Hexia's adoptive parents instilled in her. She is evil
now, and utterly without mercy. She has taken revenge
upon numerous mortal men and women who have been
Pythor's consorts over the last several centuries.

Hexia the
Green Dragon

Ch apter 6 - The Forgotten Se a

Elves of the Island
The island is stocked with elves-Hexia's favorite prey.
Several hundred elves live on the island, forced to live
like savages under constant threat of death. Whenever
they try to build homes or anything else, like a ship or
raft, Hexia arrives and tears it apart.
The few times the elves have managed to launch an
escape, Hexia has brought them back to the island,
always making sure to eat an escapee or two to maintain
her reign of terror. Causing fear and dread is part of her
regular hunting pattern, as she harries the elves during
the night before finally devouring one. Eating elves isn't
enough to keep Hexia properly fed, of course; she does it
because she loves to torment them.
The tribes consists of several hundred elves (CG
tribal warriors) along with several dozen children. They
are led by six elves from warlike cultures-four Aresian
LN warrior monks and two NE Amazon warriors.
The Aresians are determined to survive, hoping that
salvation will eventually arrive. The Amazons want to go
out in a blaze of glory and attack the green dragon in her
lair, even though they know that there would be no real
chance of success.

Event: Meeting the Elves
Hexia will not reveal herself when the heroes arrive.
She will allow them onto the island and to make contact
with the elves. Within an hour of arriving on the island

the heroes will be met by two elf warriors (LN warrior
monk and NE amazon warrior) leading a band of a
dozen elves (CG tribal warriors):




As you move through the jungle, you begin to feel that
you are being watched by many dozens of eyes. You
suddenly find yourself surrounded. Twelve camouflaged elves emerge from the foliage around you.
Despite their apparent unease, they keep their weapons stowed. Two of them step forward to speak.


The two elves introduce themselves as Darok (LN warrior monk) and Patrea (NE Amazon warrior). They
ask why the heroes have come to Hexia's island. They
have had no news of the mainland for centuries and are
very much in the dark about the prophecy.
Eventually, the elven leaders resolve that the heroes
have been sent by the gods. They interpret the party's
arrival as a sign that the dragon must be confronted,
once and for all. Their situation is desperate, and they
have lived in fear for too long.

The elves ask the party to join them in seeking out
Hexia's lair at the center of the island. If Hexia can be
defeated, then the heroes are welcome to the dragon's
treasure hoard-the elves have no use for it. Two of the
Aresians will remain behind to defend the tribe.

Event: Hunted by Hexia



Hexia will almost certainly be aware of the arrival of
intruders. She views the heroes as interesting prey and
will play a game of cat and mouse with them.
Dragon's Lair Effects. Hexia has access to all of the
lair actions of an adult green dragon, and the entire
island is subject to the regional effects of a green dragon.
As the heroes get close to Hexia's lair, they will find
themselves in a labyrinth of thorny thickets. Hexia will
launch a few hit-and-run attacks from stealth and then
lay in wait for them in her lair.
Kidnapping Pythor. If Pythor is aboard the Ultros,
then Hexia will kidnap him while the heroes are away
from the ship. She will keep him in her lair and ignore
the approach of the heroes. If they invade her lair, she
will fly into a jealous rage and fight to the death.

1. Hexia's Lair

2. Lair of the Kraken

Hexia lives in a grove at the center of the island, halfway up the mountain. There are no trails leading to this
grove. Climbing the cliffs above and below it requires a
successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

Hexia is not the only powerful creature that lairs on
the island. The following encounter is entirely optional
and is a challenge beyond the power of most heroes.
Whether the elves or Hexia have discovered the existence of the Kraken is entirely up to you.





This beautiful grove surrounds a crystal-clear pool,
which is fed by a single waterfall. The trees here are
decorated with the bones of elves and animals, which
have been arranged into flower-like shapes. Massive
piles of glittering coins, gemstones, and artifacts are
scattered throughout the pool.






Standing on this sandy pink beach, you notice a jagged
rock formation, not far from shore. A strange symbol
has been carved into the rock facing the main island. It
looks like a bulbous creature with eight snake-like arms.



Epic Path: The Demi-god
The Demi-god's mother, Ophea, has been held captive
here for decades. She has survived by flattering the dragon
with a new story about Pythor each full moon, casting the
god as a fickle lover who secretly loves Hexia. Refer to the
Running the Epic Paths section for more information.

Treasure Hoard
The crystal-clear pool is lined with 50,000 gold coins
and 50,000 silver coins. Buried throughout the silver and
gold coins are artifacts from Thylea's history. The most
valuable artifacts are a gold crown that was worn by one
of the queens of Mytros (7,500 gp); a platinum cup inset
with emeralds with the images of the Five (10,000 gp);
and a gold dragon comb (3,000 gp).
There are also two dozen less valuable objects,
including bracelets, cups, rings, necklaces, and musical
instruments (each worth 250 gp), and 80 pale green
chrysoberyl gemstones (100 gp each), 20 dark green
alexandrites (500 gp each), and 12 emeralds (1,000 gp
each). Finally, there is a single adamantine ingot.

The jagged rock island is several hundred feet from
shore. This is actually the tip of an underwater mountain that is the lair of the Kraken, perhaps the single
most dangerous creature in all of Thylea.
The Kraken serves only itself. It is the enemy of every
other living creature in Thylea, including the Titans. It
bears a strong hatred for Sydon, who has foiled many of
its schemes to wrest away control of the oceans.
The Kraken spends about a fifth of its time in its lair
and the rest of its time travelling. It roams the oceans
around Thylea and travels to other planes of existence
using a cubic gate. This means that there is a 20% chance
that the Kraken will be home when the heroes visit.
The Kraken's Silver Sphere
The Kraken's lair is in the dark, crushing depths-nearly
a mile beneath the ocean. It is accessed by an underwater tunnel that emerges into a perfect, silver-coated
sphere 250 ft. in diameter.
The Sphere. Depictions of every god in the world are
inscribed into its silver surface. If it could be mined,
the silver would be the equivalent of 10 million sp. The
chamber is always guarded by a nycaloth that is bound
in service to the Kraken. It is desperate in defense of the
lair. It has sworn an oath of service to the Kraken, and
failure to destroy trespassers would subject it to horrifying punishments on the plane of Hades.
The Kraken's Treasure
The Kraken possess two powerful magical artifacts that
it uses for its own fell purposes. It possesses a cubic gate
that it uses to travel the planes, and it keeps this item
close at all times. But the "crown jewel" in the Kraken's
collection is an orb of dragonkind.
The Dragon Orb. This orb rests on a gold pillar at
the bottom of the sphere. How the Kraken obtained this
orb is a mystery, but it must have involved pacts with
denizens of the Abyss, Hades, or Gehenna. The Kraken
intends to use the orb to battle against the Five Gods,
once they've resumed their dragon forms.
Junk Pit. Most of the items that the Kraken takes
from destroyed ships are of no use to it, so it throws
them into a refuse pit outside of its spherical lair. This
pit is now filled with gold, silver, copper, chests, jewelry,

Diving into the Depths
Volkan can construct dive suits for the party. This is the
only realistic possibility for getting down into the lair of
the Kraken without using powerful magic. Each dive suit
takes Volkan one week to construct and resembles an
unwieldy suit of plate armor with an oversized helmet.
The suit is entirely airtight. Fighting or casting spells in
the dive suit is impossible.
Reaching the Lair. Using a dive suit, it takes one hour
to reach the Kraken's lair. For each hour spent in the lair,
there is a 20% chance that the Kraken will return.

and gems. For every hour spent searching the pile, roll
on the Treasure Hoard Table in the 5th Edition Game
Master's Guide for challenge rating 11-16. After twelve
rolls, the hoard is exhausted of all recoverable items.
The Crushing Depths
The pressure of the ocean at this depth is deadly to any
creature that is not explicitly immune to such damage.
The pressure deals out 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage every
round. Spells or abilities with water breathing effects do
not protect against this damage.

Typhon, the Maw




The sea grows rough as a massive volcanic island comes
into view. Its central peak belches thick black smoke and
white-hot lava. Although you can see black sand beaches
on the shore, choppy waters and the ring of jagged rocks
protruding from the sea make a safe landfall challenging.


The waters around this island are always rough. There
are a couple of black, sandy beaches where landings can be made, but navigating through the rocks
that surround the island requires a successful DC 15
Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failure, the ship takes
250 damage to its hull that must be repaired.
This island is called Typhon, but it has several other
names: the "Island of Horror," the "Island of the Maw,"



and the "Father of Monsters." At the center of the island
is a scar in the fabric of reality, a gaping pit that connects
the mortal world to the plane of Hades. Legend has it
that many of the warped monstrosities that haunt the
world came from here-hence its name.
Throughout history, many individuals have come here
seeking power, but no one leaves the island without
being twisted in some unexpected way. Terrible creatures such as the chimera and the manticore are thought
to have first spawned upon this island.
The island is an active volcano that towers nearly a
mile into the sky, with flaming rivers of molten rocks
running down the sides and boiling into the ocean.
There is no easy way up its slopes, but for those willing to make the journey, there are three different cave
entrances that lead into the Maw.

The Cave of Excess


The Cave of Vulgarity




Immediately upon entering this cave, you are struck by
the rank odor of feces, stale sweat, and rotting meat.
Half-eaten fish fins, cracked bones, and humanoid
appendages litter the floor before you.
Farther into the cave, you find a grotesquely bloated
man with a canine head lying back in a pile of filth. The
disgusting creature fixes a hungry gaze on you.




The creature is an arcanaloth that uses this cave as
a lair. Unlike most of its kind, it is immensely fat and
spends much of its time wallowing in a pit of its own
filth. It no longer has a fly speed, and its walk speed
is only 15 ft. It summons mezzoloths to fish in the
ocean and bring it back fresh food. It prefers dolphins,
mermen, and occasionally, trespassing mortals. Its appetites change by the moment. Its cave is scattered with
half-eaten corpses of all of those creatures.
The arcanaloth doesn't attack immediately. It calls
itself"Hunger," and it demands food from the party. It
will allow a hero to pass through its cave into the Maw
if given a proper sacrifice of food. Livestock totaling 500
pounds or more will satisfy it.
If a fight breaks out, there is a 25% chance that 1d4
mezzoloths will return with food for the arcanaloth
within 1d6 rounds. They will fight to the death.

The Cave of Vanity




The halls of this cave are lined with extremely lifelike
marble statues, some broken. Each depicts a beautiful
woman with a face showing abject fear.
A slithering noise deeper inside the cavern draws
your attention to the mistress of this cave: a towering
woman with scaly skin, a muscular serpentine lower
body, and a swarm of writhing snakes in place of hair.


Ch apter 6 - The Forgotten Se a







The incubus who lives in this cave generally takes on
the appearance of a male satyr. He possesses a rod of
rulership, which he activates at sunset each day to take
control of all of his captives. It amuses him to transform
his captives into mindless revelers every night. At dawn,
he forces them into a bronze cage and leaves the cave to
hunt for fresh meat on the island.
The incubus's captives include two satyrs, one male
oread, and one female aurae nymph. There are also
sailors from across Thylea, including an Aresian warrior
(LN warrior monk), two Amazons (NE amazon warriors), and a Mytrosian soldier (LG captain). When under
the influence of the rod of rulership, these mind-controlled captives are unabashed pleasure-seekers who
defend their master to the death.
During the daytime, the captives hunger for freedom and revenge against the incubus. They will help
the heroes in any way they can. Unlocking the cages
requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check with
thieves' tools. The incubus returns at sunset.

The Maw

A eurayle medusa lives in this cave. She has an arrangement with Moxena, the Lady of Coins, who delivers
beautiful women to the medusa in exchange for abyssal
secrets from the Maw.
The eurayle likes to toy with her victims before
turning them to stone, so she will attempt to pick off
the heroes individually. She hides in the shadows and
creates distracting sounds to encourage the party to
split up and investigate. She has an intimate knowledge
of the cave layout. She strikes suddenly and without
warning.
Treasure. One of the petrified heroes in the room
carries a mace of smiting. It cannot be removed from
his grip without curing his petrification or shattering
the hand that wields the mace.
188



Moans and screams can be heard from within this
cave mouth, growing louder as you move inside.
After a few minutes of walking, you come to a
large, dimly-lit cavern. There, a man with the legs of a
goat and great black curved horns reclines on a rocky
throne. In his hands he holds an ornate gold scepter,
which he fondles as he gazes at the spectacle at his
feet: a wine-soaked bacchanal of revelers indulging
their carnal passions.

The Maw is the central cone of the volcano. It is filled
with a fiery maelstrom of magma that slowly circles
the black pit at its center. The magma empties into this
pit of blackness and thus keeps the volcano relatively
stable-the island never grows larger.
Falling into the pit means almost certain death. The
magma inflicts 55 (10d10) fire damage per round.
Anyone who survives is sucked into the black vortex,
which leads to the plane of Hades.
Hades is a barren place, leached of all color and bleak
with despair. Ash constantly rains from the sky, spewed
forth by volcanic peaks that stick out of the blasted
wasteland. The fate of anyone who remains too long
in this realm of wickedness is to be transformed into a
writhing larva, a slug-like creature.
Tempting Whispers
Anyone who looks into the Maw can hear two whispering voices. One voice makes promises of great rewards
for any brave enough to enter the Maw, while the other

voice threatens dire consequences for not plunging
into the pit. Anyone who listens to the whispers risks
madness and worse, but there is also the possibility of
gaining great power.
For each round that a hero spends listening to the
whispers in the Maw, roll on the Effects of the Maw table
and consult the Gift column. Add +10% to the roll for
each round spent listening after the first.
If the listener accepts the gift, then roll on the Curse
column of the table, using the same bonus that was used
for the Gift roll. If the listener becomes afflicted with the
curse of the harpy or the curse of the medusa, then refer to
Introduction: The Laws of Thylea for details. Do not tell
the player that they have been afflicted by a curse at this
point. They will discover the curse over the days to come.

madness which includes a permanent fear of the Island
of the Maw. They will want to leave the island by the
quickest possible route. This fear of the island and the
indefinite madness are permanent unless cured by
greater restoration. If the madness is cured, then the
voices will never speak to the listener again.

Epic Path: The Cursed One

Island of Time
This island appears unremarkable until the heroes sail
within a mile of the shore. Read the following:




Your ship approaches another island. Its shoreline is
obscured by a strange shimmering in the air. As you
sail closer, you feel the ocean currents strengthening
below the keel, pulling your vessel into a powerful
wind that propels you to an impossible speed. In a
matter of moments, the ship sails three times around
the island. The sun falls toward the horizon and
rapidly sets. The sky soon darkens. As the stars circle
above your head, you are overcome with waves of
crippling nausea.




On the last journey around the island, each hero must
make three DC 15 Constitution saving throws or else
they fall unconscious for one minute. Whether the
heroes are conscious or not, the ship abruptly slows and
floats into a tranquil bay.
An ancient crumbling dock made from obsidian juts
out into the water of the bay. The sky above is filled with
more stars than the heroes have ever seen before; heroes
with a passive Perception score of 15 or higher will
notice that stars occasionally wink out of existence or
abruptly transform into bright clouds of light.
It is always night on the Island of Time. The inhabitants of the island are enigmatic sphinxes. The motivations of these entities is hidden, but they are known to
possess great knowledge-it's possible that they know
Ch apter 6 - The Forgotten Se a

189

more than any other beings in the world. They also
guard strange artifacts on the island.
Almost all the land is covered in dozens of ruins,
consisting of strange buildings made from obsidian, adamantine, and various unknown minerals. The buildings
look nothing like those built by human hands: some are
shaped like pyramids, while others are obelisks with
strange runes and symbols inscribed on every surface.
Who or what constructed this place is unknown to
anyone-even the gods know nothing of it.

Event: Riddles and Tests
When the heroes make landfall, they are greeted by a
gynosphinx. She appears next to the party suddenly, but
it seems as if she's always been there. It's possible that
she's been waiting for the party since the dawn of time.


Exploring the Island
Because of the strange nature of time on this island, it
is difficult to explore it in a logical fashion, the way the
party might explore a dungeon. Instead, the party experiences the island as a series of montages, losing track of
time and space while traveling between each area.
The Passage of Time
This island has an ethereal, dream-like quality to it. The
heroes may come to believe that they are dreaming
rather than awake. As the GM, you should make a show
of keeping meticulous track of time on the island. Every
minute that passes is counted by the sphinxes and factors
into the encounters that trigger.

Ch apter 6 - The Forgotten Se a



A creature with a woman's face, a feline body, and
great feathered wings appears next to you.
"I bear your kind no ill will, and I hope you find the
knowledge and treasures you seek here," she says to
you in a calm and assuring voice. It's almost like she's
continuing a conversation that you forgot you were
part of, answering a question you forgot you asked.
"But know this: He is coming. If He finds you, He
will devour your flesh, your soul, and your very history.
Nothing shall remain. Three roars announce His arrival.
Three, and no more. This is the time that He has
alotted you. Use it wisely." When you look again, the
sphinx has vanished. Perhaps she was never there at all.




She refers to an androsphinx, the lord of the island. The
roars are his way of forcing the heroes to choose only
two locations to explore out of the three available. If the

party explores all three locations, they will summon the
wrath of the androsphinx.
Exploring the Island. The heroes find that they
'remember' three locations on the island that can be
explored. They must choose from the following: The
Stone Table, The Overlook, and The Pit of Stars.
The Androsphinx's Roar. After exploring each location, the heroes hear the androsphinx's roar echo across
the island. The third time he roars, he appears in front
of the party and attacks. When that happens, refer to the
Confronting the Androsphinx section for details.

1. The Stone Table




At the highest point of this strange island, you come
upon a bizarre dinner party. A massive stone table
with a dozen matching chairs stands out in the open.
An ogre-sized man sits at the head of the table, fast
asleep. His four human-sized guests are much too small
for the chairs that they sit in. The humanoids are also
asleep. They are almost completely hidden by their
hair, which has grown extremely long and unkempt.


buildings are richer and on a grander scale. Statues of
the heroes stand in many plazas.
• The third viewing show Mytros a thousand years into
the future. The city is under siege by a vast fleet of
vessels from the outer world beyond Thylea. Anyone
from outside Thylea will recognize some of the flags,
but some of the details seem wrong.
• The fourth viewing shows Mytros 10,000 years into
the future. The city lies in ruins. Strange, ogre-sized
humanoids work in the dust, digging up artifacts from
the ruins. The artifacts are corroded shards of the
statues of the heroes, unrecognizable with age.
• The fifth viewing shows something indescribable and
alien, 100,000 years into the future. The viewer gains
one indefinite madness.
• A sixth viewing shows nothing. The telescope has
gone completely dark and never functions again.

3. The Pit of Stars




The ogre-sized man is dressed in fine weapons and
armor. The table is perfectly proportioned for him.
None of the sleepers can be awakened by the heroes
alone. Refer to Riddles of the Androsphinx for details.



2. The Overlook




You come to the north shore of the island, an area
covered in strange green metal. The metal extends into
an outcropping that forms a platform over a steep cliff.
On the far edge of the platform is a large telescope.




This overlook stands at the top of a 1,000 ft. cliff with
jagged rocks below it. The telescope is 20 ft. long, and it
is fashioned from bronze. Anyone who looks into it sees
the distant city of Mytros.
The first time someone looks through this telescope,
they see Mytros in the present day.






• The second viewing shows Mytros a century into

the future. The city looks similar, but the walls and



When the sphinx is slain, its body rots away rapidly and
then disintegrates into dust. You hear a whisper on the
wind. "We shall meet again, in time..."


Looking through the telescope, you see the great city
of Mytros. The bronze colossus of Pythor stands watch
over the bay, which is bustling with merchant ships.
Marble and bronze buildings line the city's many busy
streets, in the shadow of Mount Volkan.

If the viewer looks away, or someone else looks into the
telescope, the image of Mytros changes:



Looking into the void for more than one round requires
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or else the viewer will
gain a short-term madness. Anyone who falls or jumps
into the pit is apparently lost in the void forever. Heroes
lost in this way will return to the party during the battle
with the androsphinx who rules the island.
The narrow stone stairway leads down to the lair of
a hierocosphinx. The hierocosphinx guards a sealed
circular door made from adamantine. Beyond that door
lies a treasure vault. The sphinx smiles when the heroes
arrive and asks if they have come for a taste of the treasures of the ages. Regardless of the party's answer, the
sphinx attacks and fights to the death.







You come to the edge of a vast pit that engulfs the
center of the island. Beyond the edge of the pit, you
can see a black void full of bright stars. A narrow stone
stairway winds its way down along the edge of the pit,
leading to a door-sized opening in the rock.



The adamantine vault door opens easily, revealing the
treasure at the center of the island. The treasure seems
to materialize into existence as soon as the vault door is
opened-almost as if reacting to the party's needs.
Treasure. The vault contains a Quiver of Ehlonna.
Within the quiver are twenty arrows of empyrean
slaying. These arrows are very effective against the
Titans-Sydon, Lutheria, and their young empyrean
children.
Ch apter 6 - The Forgotten Se a

Confronting the Androsphinx
When the androsphinx roars for the third time, he suddenly appears in front of the party, ready for battle.
The androsphinx uses all of his powers to defeat the
party, including his lair actions. He starts by using a lair
action to make the heroes younger. His next lair action
takes the heroes to the Far Realm.


Riddles of the Androsphinx
If the heroes are defeated by the sphinx, they have one
more chance to survive. The androsphinx asks the
party a series of riddles. Each correctly-answered riddle
means that at least one hero is spared. You may choose
to spare more than one hero for each correct answer.
The sphinx devours any hero who refuses to answer.



You find yourselves transported to an alien world.
Overhead, the sky is black and starless. The ground is
a mosaic of your own horrified faces. It looks as if you
were all buried in the earth, your heads thrown back,
your faces locked together in a grotesque pattern.
An obsidian moon hangs low in the sky, and blood
drips from its craters, splashing to the ground where
disembodied faces lap at it greedily. The blood pools
at your feet and begins to take hideous form-gigantic
floating brains, which snap their cruel, bird-like beaks,
reaching toward you with hideous tentacles.


These creatures are grell. There is one for each hero,
and they fight to the death.
After three rounds of combat in this horrific landscape, the sphinx summons the party back to the Island
of Time. Any hero who disappeared into the Pit of Stars
will reappear at this point, but they return with one
random indefinite madness. Now, the sphinx attacks the
party directly, without holding back.

Riddle Me This...
These riddles are examples. Use any riddle that you like.

• Riddle: The first part of Nestor,
The last part of Orion,
The first part of nothing,
And the final part of man.
>> Answer: The letter 'N'.

• Riddle: I never was, am always to be,



No one ever saw me, nor ever will;
And yet I am the confidence of all,
To live and breathe upon midnight's call.
>> Answer: Tomorrow.

• Riddle: What can you catch but not throw?
>> Answer: Sickness or disease.
• Riddle: We are not flesh, feather, scales nor bone;
Yet we still have fingers and thumbs of our own.
>> Answer: Gloves.

Feast of the Androsphinx
If the party satisfies the androsphinx with their answers,
then he will invite them to a feast. If they accept, he
summons them to The Stone Table.
The scene at The Stone Table is slightly altered from
before: any hero who has disappeared or been devoured
on the island is asleep in one of the oversized chairs, and
their hair has grown ridiculously long.
Waking the Sleepers. Anyone asleep at the table, with
the exception of the armored ogre, can be awakened
by shaking them. The sleepers-including any "eaten"
heroes-now have a random long-term madness. They
cannot remember their names or how they got to the
table. They babble about being trapped on the island
for an eternity, watching as the cycle of the multiverse
repeated before their eyes, over and over again.
The Heroes' Feast. The table is covered by a heroes'
feast. Anyone who eats this feast gains its benefits for an
entire week rather than 24 hours. They also immediately
fall asleep. The androsphinx will wait until everyone

has eaten. If anyone does not he will breathe on them
and cause them to fall asleep anyway. When the heroes
awaken, they are back on their ship in the middle of the
ocean. The Island of Time disappears forever.
Sleepers at the Stone Table
The sleepers are all powerful warriors from some point in
the history of Thylea. One of them might even be a hero
from Earth's history or mythology, but that individual will
remember events happening differently than what has
been recorded. A great victory might have been a defeat
in their memory, or they might remember that one of the
gods was a demon lord... Feel free to be as inventive as
you like. None of them are willing to leave, as they are all
waiting for "a friend" to arrive, though they are unable to
remember their friend's identity.
None of these sleepers are equipped or have prepared
spells but, in the unlikely event that the party does battle
with them, you may use the following NPC statistics:
archmage, assassin, gladiator and mage.

Charybdis, The Ravening Mouth




Your ship is suddenly slammed by a storm gale.
Violent waves crash over the deck, and the ship is
sucked into a powerful current, leaving your oarsmen
helpless. Lightning flashes, illuminating a massive
whirlpool just ahead of you. As your ship draws closer,
you can see two massive stone hands reaching out of
the maelstrom, beckoning you into a broad funnel of
water, which leads down into the deepest fathoms of
the sea.




This is Charybdis, an infamous whirlpool known to
all Thylean sailors. It is a portal to the Nether Sea
that is kept open by two of Kentimane's hands, and it
is legendary for swallowing entire ships. By the time
the heroes can see Charybdis, the ocean's powerful

currents have already started to drag their ship toward
the whirlpool.
Spells such as gust of wind, wind wall, or a conjured
air elemental will allow the character's ship to skirt
the whirlpool and avoid it. If magic is not used, then
someone must steer the ship with a successful DC 20
Wisdom (Survival) check. If that fails, then the ship will
be sucked into the whirlpool and transported to the
Nether Sea. Refer to the Nether Sea chapter to continue
the adventure.




Rather than sucking your ship down to the ocean floor,
the whirlpool has apparently transported you to a dark,
abyssal sea. The waters that now surround you are
black and expansive, stretching in all directions under a
claustrophobic sky, which is full of strange lights.




Praxys, Tower of Sydon
Praxys is the dwelling place of Sydon, the Lord of
Storms. It is a great tower of stone, which stands atop a
headland of limestone. Sydon's tower projects a piercing ray of light which can be seen from miles away as it
sweeps the ocean, searching for trespassers.

Praxys is located in the Forgotten Sea, but it is much
too grand to be detailed here. If the party sets a course
for the constellation of the Titan (XVI), then refer to the
Praxys, Tower of Sydon chapter to continue the adventure. Reaching the tower should be very difficult.

Chapter 7:

The Nether Sea
"My sojourn into the Nether Sea was a time
of joyful awakening. The Lady of Dreams dotes
on her most loyal servants like a jealous mother,
but she relentlessly tortures those who defy her.
Surrounded on all sides by such death and darkness, one cannot help but feel alive."

T

-Chondrus, Servant of Lutheria

he Nether Sea is dark and dangerous.
Its inky waters are all that remain of the
raw material that the gods used to fashion
the world at the dawn of time. This sea of
cosmic matter continues to exist for reasons that are
hidden even from the gods. The sea is littered with
rocky islands and rapids, and the islands are covered in
strange, twisted trees and colossal forms.
Although the Nether Sea is located within a vast
underground cavern, the sky above is filled with colorful
stars and galaxies. The cavern roof above the Nether
Sea is almost a half-mile above the water. It is lined with
vast lodes of silver and mithral. These deposits reflect
the light that emanates from the stars, which are actually
magical rifts connected to the Astral Plane.

194

Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a

The Nether Sea is a vast prison vault where the gods
have hidden ancient weapons and powerful creatures
that have no place in the world above. It is also the
domain of the Titan Lutheria, the Lady of Dreams. She
travels the Nether Sea on her throne ship, a great bronze
vessel called Hypnos, which is harnessed and pulled by
Talieus, one of her ancient siblings.
Connected to the Underdark
The Nether Sea is connected to the vast network
of tunnels and caverns that makes up the world's
Underdark. Sometimes creatures from the Underdark
will stumble into the realm of the Nether Sea, but without a powerful ship like the Ultros, they are unable to
make it very far before succumbing to the chaos of its
primordial waters.

Traveling to the Nether Sea
There are two ways to get to the Nether Sea. Neither of
these methods are well known, even among the gods.
They must be discovered through research or by seeking
out extremely wise creatures, such as sphinxes.
The Dead Falls
The River Lethe empties into a huge rift called The Dead
Falls, which descends all the way to the Nether Sea. This

method is extremely dangerous, as the mile-long drop
is enough to kill most creatures and shatter most ships.
Estor Arkelander's ghost is aware of this method, but he
refuses to share it with the party unless they have agreed
to his bargain.

Effects of the Primordial Waters

Charybdis, The Ravening Maw
The great whirlpool known as Charybdis in the
Forgotten Sea can transport a ship to the Nether Sea.
Very few ships have ever returned from this journey.
This is because the dark waters of the Nether Sea
quickly eat away the wooden hulls of most ships.

Arriving in the Nether Sea
When the heroes first arrive in the Nether Sea, read the
following narrationt text:




After a few moments of disorientation, you assess your
new surroundings. Monotonous black waves and alien
skies stretch for as far as the eye can see. The stars are
strange and unrecognizable. In stark contrast to the
roiling oceans above, everything here is deathly silent.
The smell of briney seawater has been replaced with
a pervasive metallic odor. You can hear something
sizzling against the hull of your ship.




If the heroes arrived here by sailing through the massive
whirlpool of Charybdis, then they appear several miles
in a random direction from the whirlpool's location in
the Nether Sea (N1).

Primordial Waters
The Nether Sea is dangerous for many reasons, but
the water itself is the most immediate risk. For one
thing, the waters are acidic, and each day, they inflict 30
damage to the ship's hull. The Ultros has been magically
protected from the waters of the Nether Sea, so it only
takes 5 acid damage per day.
Primordial Whales. Massive, whale-like creatures
sometimes surface in the Nether Sea. Ships that draw
too close to them risk capsizing in their wake. These
gargantuan beasts don't react to attacks unless they take
more than 100 damage, and then they simply submerge
beneath the waters once more. The whale creatures have
AC 22 and are immune to most conditions: blinded,
charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned. They
have unlimited uses of legendary resistance.
Drinking the Water. Anyone who drinks the seawater
or submerges themselves are immediately affected by
the warping effects of the cosmic matter. The first time
someone interacts with the water, the effects wear off
after one hour. The second time they touch the water,
the effects last one day. The third time, the effects
become permanent. Re-roll the effect each time.

Leaving the Nether Sea
Leaving the Nether Sea is easier than getting here. The
Charybdis whirlpool is the most obvious way to leave.
Ships that sail into Charybdis from the Nether Sea will
defy physics and sail upwards to the roof of the enormous cavern. The ship emerges a few miles from the
whirlpool on the surface of the Cerulean Gulf.
Control Water. The control water spell can also be
used to leave the Nether Sea. If cast upon the primordial
waters, the effects will be much different than if it had
been cast on the surface. Instead of creating a whirlpool,
the spell will create a massive spout of water. Effectively,
the spell can be used to create a temporary Charybdis at
any location in the Nether Sea.

This is an inverted whirlpool known as Charybdis.
Sailing into it will deposit a ship on the surface of the
Forgotten Sea, a few miles away from the gargantuan
whirlpool. There is, however, a 5% chance that any ship
entering Charybdis will be utterly annihilated by the
cosmic forces that power it. In this case, the crew will
find themselves clinging to wreckage in the Cerulean
Gulf. Depending on their actions as the ship is swept
upwards, they may be able to salvage their equipment.

N2. The River Lethe




Your vessel drifts towards what appears to be a heavy
rain storm. Strangely, no strong winds can be felt and
the nearby waves remain calm. The "storm" does not
seem to move. It remains in one place and seems to be
confined to a narrow area. The falling rain smells fresh,
and lacks the acidic odor of the surrounding waters.




The River Lethe falls from the ceiling of the Nether Sea
cavern above, starting from the Dead Falls. By this point,
it is like torrential freshwater rain.
Lutheria sails into this constant rainstorm every day
so that she can keep her gardens properly watered.
Therefore, staying close to the River Lethe's falls is
an excellent way to find and confront Lutheria. See
Lutheria's Barge at the end of this section for details.

tell jokes. She sews your mouth shut if you don't laugh
at her jokes. It's always better to laugh at her jokes.
• Lutheria loves to play games. She especially loves the
Royal Game (the game of twenty squares). Challenging
her to the game can put her in a better mood, but you
should always let her win.
• Lutheria roams the Nether Sea. Lutheria's barge is
almost impossible to find unless she chooses to reveal
herself to you. However, she takes an interest in any
threat to her domain. For example, the Gargantuan
Cubes (N6) are prisons for powerful weapons. If the
heroes can awaken one of the imprisoned weapons,
the noise would echo across the entire Nether Sea and
summon Lutheria to them. The Titan knows the word
that unlocks The Prison Cube. He will whisper this
almost unpronounceable primordial word to anyone
who asks him for it. Whoever hears the word gains a
random short-term madness (see the Game Master's
Guide), but they cannot say the word until they stand
before the locked entrance. The word remains in their
mind until they speak it, and then they will forget it.
• The waters of the Nether Sea are strange. One must
be cautious with the waters here. Spells that manipulate water, such as control water, may have unpredictable effects.
The Forgotten Titans
For more information about the lost siblings of Sydon and
Lutheria, refer to the War of the Titans in the Secrets and
Myths appendix.

N3. Titan Island




Your ship approaches a small craggy island dominated
by gray mountains and black, rocky beaches. Among
the mountains stand three incredibly lifelike statues
which are similar in scale to the great colossi of Mytros.
Each depicts a muscular man in a pose suggesting
shock, their faces revealing a combination of fear and
rage. Iron chains bind their immobile limbs and are
anchored in the surrounding landscape.


N4. The Mirror Prison


• Lutheria is insane. Sydon once tried to cure his sister
by forging weapons from the psychic energy of her
madness (Hall of Armaments, H6). These weapons
may be especially effective against her.

196

Dim lights dance upon the horizon. As your ship
moves closer, you discover their source: an immense,
partially submerged crystalline structure reflects the
strange light of this strange place. Countless flat panels
connect at strange angles, creating a vaguely pyramid
shape. Near the waterline is a gaping hole large enough
to allow passage by the Ultros. Jagged edges suggest
that this entryway was made by force rather than being
an original feature of this odd structure.



Three ancient Titans are petrified on this island. They
are siblings of Sydon and Lutheria, and all three tower to
50 feet in height. Two of them are entirely inert, but one
still has the ability to speak. If this statue is approached,
its eyes open and its head turns slightly toward whoever
has come near. Dust rains down as it strains against the
magic that petrifies its body.
The speaking titan is quite mad and doesn't even
remember its name, although it knows that it was betrayed
and trapped by Sydon and Lutheria. It also knows a few
secrets that could be used against Sydon or Lutheria:

Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a



This huge crystal structure rises out of the Nether Sea.
The Kraken was once imprisoned here, but it escaped
and now dwells in the Forgotten Sea. A gaping hole
near the water line allows access into the interior of the
mirror prison. A ship such as the Ultros can sail into this
hole to the interior of the crystal structure.
The walls and ceiling of the interior are covered in
hundreds of square mirrors, each 6 feet to a side. These
mirrors reflect whoever enters the prison, and each

Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a

197

mirror shows a warped version of the viewer. At the rear
of the crystal structure's interior is a small island made
from broken mirrors. Gold, silver, and gemstones are
piled on the island in a large hoard.
The Dragon's Lair
This island is the lair of an adult brass dragon named
Hezzebal. Hezzebal was the mount of a Dragonlord
who explored the Nether Sea five centuries ago, scouting
for a location to hide the treasures of the Dragonlords.
Hezzebal broke into the Mirror Prison and accidentally
released the Kraken in the process. The Kraken sealed
the dragon inside the prison and then tormented him by
slowly and messily devouring his bonded Dragonlord.
Over centuries, the mirrors warped Hezzebal so
that his wings became twisted, and his alignment has
changed to evil. Hezzebal now lairs in the broken prison,
occasionally going out into the Nether Sea to hunt.
Hezzebal usually lurks beneath the water, having
become immune to the effects of the Nether Sea. He will
surface to converse with intruders if they start to loot his
dragon hoard. He will reveal his history to gain sympathy and will inquire about the party's purpose here.
Epic Paths: The Forgotten Dragon
If the Vanished One is present, then Hezzebal recognizes
them as one of the ancient Dragonlords and blames
them for his long imprisonment. He believes that the
Dragonlords deliberately left him here-that they only
ever saw the dragons as tools to be used and discarded.
Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

If the heroes reveal that they are enemies of Lutheria,
then he explains that she is a vain creature. She visits
the River Lethe with some frequency, in order to water
her gardens. He has always kept his distance from her.
Eventually, Hezzebal will grow bored of talking and will
try to devour the heroes.
Battling Hezzebal. Hezzebal cannot fly. He has a
swim speed of 80 feet, he is immune to the effects of the
Nether Sea, and he has water breathing. His madness
can be cured with a greater restoration spell, but it must
be cast three times, and he will interpret it as a hostile
action. If his madness is cured, his alignment reverts to
good, but he has three permanent levels of exhaustion.
The Mirrors
Use the table below to randomly determine what someone sees upon looking into a mirror. Once someone has
looked into a mirror, it may be removed from the wall
and taken away for use elsewhere, but doing so requires
a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Otherwise the
mirror will shatter when it is taken down.

If the Lost One is present, then the fabled treasures of
the Dragonlords are among the dragon's hoard. Estor will
demand to claim one item first, but he will not specify his

the xiphos of slaughter.
The Lost One should choose the items that they want
from the list of possible rewards for their epic path. The
other items from the list are not present. Refer to the
Running the Epic Paths section for details.

The Oathbreakers
The island is surrounded by an entropic field which sustains prisoners, eliminating the need for them to eat or
drink, although they are perpetually hungry and thirsty.
There are hundreds of mortals still alive on the island
and thousands of corpses, some centuries dead. Every
one of these prisoners is chained to the central column
that rises from the center of the island.

A small, rocky island rises from the inky black sea. From
a distance, its surface appears to be covered by a forest
of twisted, leafless trees that begins near the waterline.
Closer inspection reveals that the trees are petrified,
made from the same dark gray stone as the rest of the
island. A great column of the same stone rises high
above their tallest branches at the forest's center.

This island is where all oathbreakers from Thylea are
brought by Lutheria's erinyes. It is a place of punishment for any who break solemnly-sworn oaths, and

The cube that hangs closest to Titan Island (N3) is the
only cube that the heroes are able to gain access to. They
must have learned the primordial word from the living
Titan on that island in order to enter it.

The Wisest Prisoner
The most helpful prisoner on the island is a woman
named Oresteia (NE mage). Oresteia is one of very few
prisoners who can speak, because she's wise enough
to flatter the Lady of Dreams during her annual visits.
Oresteia has two pieces of advice for the heroes:

• Always laugh at Lutheria's jokes.
• Challenge Lutheria to the Royal Game.

Hanging Prison Cubes

Oresteia has earned preferential treatment from the
Lady of Dreams for decades by following this advice. She
keeps the Titan entertained by humoring her jokes and
devising surprising new strategies for the Royal Game.
Lutheria has even ordered the ultroloth to keep the
mage in some measure of comfort, bringing her wine
and stale bread from time to time.
Oresteia warns the heroes that Lutheria will always
win the game of twenty squares, because she's devised
some way to cheat. The Titan loves winning almost as
much as she hates losing. However, the magic she uses
to cheat at the game also seems to drain her energy. The
mage has never pushed her luck enough to try and win
the game, but it's possible that Lutheria will be more
vulnerable after a particularly rousing game.

Lutheria's Barge

Hanging from the ceiling of the Nether Sea there are several other cubes that contain other weapons of the gods.
These weapons are unfathomably dangerous creatures,
just as terrible as a tarrasque or kraken. These prisons
cannot be opened just yet, but they will come into play
later. Refer to the Apokalypsis chapter for details.

N6. Gargantuan Cubes




Your vessel sails towards an island that seems strangely
square-shaped. It soon becomes clear that the island
is actually a gargantuan iron cube. Runes have been
deeply etched into each of the faces you can see. The
bottom face is level with the surface of the sea; the top
face, some hundred feet above, hangs from five massive chains. The chains disappear into the fathomless
heavens of the Nether Sea. A disturbing noise echoes
from within the structure, alternating between a low
rumble and a high whistle.




A movement on the horizon breaks the gloomy monotony of the Nether Sea. A pair of immense shapes come
into view: the first is the upper body of a colossal male
humanoid wading through the waves. Rags obscure
much of his face, but it is clear that his lips have been
sealed shut. Scars cover his muscular body as he
trudges slowly onward, gripping onto a great length
of chain. He pulls a massive, impressive bronze barge.
Lush green plants spill over the top of the barge-a
verdant garden in a lifeless expanse of black ocean.




A huge iron cube, 100 feet on each edge, hangs from five
massive chains: four chains attach to the top corners of
the cube, and the last attaches to the center of the cube's



This barge is Hypnos, the dwelling place of Lutheria.
This massive bronze vessel is pulled by Talieus (LN
empyrean), a 200-foot-tall Titan who has been blinded
and broken by his malevolent sister. He wades through
the Nether Sea, eternally pulling Lutheria's barge.
Lutheria's barge is a hanging garden that features lush
plants, vines, and trees. Fantastical flowers grow in the
garden, of almost every kind imaginable, and their perfume almost drowns out the acidic smell of the Nether
Sea. If the heroes approach Lutheria's barge, refer to the
Hypnos, Throne of Dreams section.

We know that the Titans possess powers that have yet to be revealed. My mother forced
them into a stalemate before they ever became desperate enough to unleash such horrors.
But the time may yet come when we learn what was locked away at the dawn of time.

The Prison Cube
This gargantuan iron cube, 100 feet on each edge,
hangs from five massive chains. The center chain has a
strange contraption attached to it: an hourglass made
from transparent adamantine. About two thirds of the
sand inside is in the bottom half of the hourglass, while
the rest pours slowly down. Inside the cube is one of
the weapons of the gods, a tarrasque. There are also
primordial golems that have existed since the creation of the cube. These undying constructs are there to
protect the workings of the cube and make sure that the
tarrasque is fed.

to speak the primordial word of power that was used
to create the cube. This word can be learned from the
living Titan on Titan Island (N3). The legend lore spell
can also be used to reveal it.
The primordial word is pretty much unpronounceable
by mortals. It will appear in a hero's mind, be used once
to open the portal, and then vanish. The players don't
actually need to know or speak the word. They only
need to know that it exists in one hero's mind.
The Hourglass. A successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Arcana) check reveals that it will take three centuries
for all the sand to run into the bottom of the hourglass.
This is some sort of timing mechanism. Eventually, the
creature imprisoned inside will awaken and return to
the surface: this happens once every thousand years.

History of the Cube
While Lutheria was originally ordered by her father
Kentimane to watch over the weapons of the gods, she
has tricked an ancient ultroloth to do the work instead.
Lutheria deceived the creature by promising him
dominion over an eternal kingdom in the Nether Sea.
The ultroloth is bound to the cube until Lutheria dies,
or until she releases him from his oath.

B2. Entry Chamber


Primordial Golems
Primordial golems are unfinished creatures that the
gods left behind to guard their weapons. They look like
featureless humanoids and they have the same statistics
as clay golems except that they are Medium instead of
Large-sized. In battle, they will attack the same target
until it is dead. Whenever they reduce the hit point maximum of their current target with their slam attack, they
will take on the appearance of that target.
For example, if their target is a dwarf, then they will
grow shorter and stockier after the first hit. Next round,
they will grow a beard. A primordial golem will look identical to its chosen target by the time it has reduced the
target's hit point maximum by 40 or more.



General Features of the Cube
The inside of the cube is strangely cold and alien.

• The ceilings are 15 ft. high, unless otherwise noted.
• All of the doors are made from iron.
• All of the rooms are unlit.

B3. Chamber of Worms


B1. Entrance

The door at the corner of the iron cube is the entrance.
It is a circular hatchway made from adamantine, and
it is invulnerable to damage. The only way to open it is







The floor of this chamber is filled with huge, writhing
worms that wriggle and squirm over each other. The
effect is quite disturbing. A narrow bridge crosses to
the other side of the room, some five feet above the
hideous, writhing worms. A featureless humanoid
golem stands guard in the middle of the bridge.



At the very top of the gargantuan iron cube, there is
a complex contraption like a massive hourglass that
stands more than 30 feet tall. Sand empties from the
top half of the hourglass into the bottom half, with
aching slowness. Drilled into one corner of the cube's
surface, there is a circular portal of black metal.




A spiral stair leads down into this room. It is guarded by
two primordial golems. They will not move to attack
until an intruder steps onto the floor of the chamber.
They fight until destroyed.

KEY LOCATIONS




As you descend the spiral staircase and enter the
chamber below, you are met by dark, gloomy surroundings. A sense of dread fills the air. You feel a strange
presence before noticing two featureless humanoid
statues, standing motionless in the corner of the room.



The floor is covered with hundreds of juvenile purple
worms. These are the tarrasque's food supply. Each of
the purple worms has the statistics of a giant poisonous
snake. If someone enters the pit, they will be attacked
by 2d6 worms each round. The primordial golem will
try to knock intruders from the bridge into the vat of
Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a

201

purple worms. The worms will not attack the primordial
golem, because it doesn't appear to be food.
Area damage spells such as fireball can kill most (but
not all) of the worms. Some worms will always survive,
hidden beneath the corpses. No more than 5,000 XP can
be earned here from slaughtering the worms.

B4. Breeding Chamber




This must be some sort of breeding chamber for the
worms. Two giant purple colored worms, more than
thirty feet in length, are chained and entwined with
one another in the center of the room. Featureless
humanoid golems work on the worms, paying little
attention to anything else in front of them.


202

Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a



This is the breeding chamber for the tarrasque's food.
Purple worms breed in a manner similar to earth
worms. The two purple worms join together and pass
genetic material to one another. This is stored in sacs
and then a cocoon forms on the body of each worm,
with each cocoon holding 1d6 wormlings. Once these
worm-filled cocoons are large enough, they are taken to
the Chamber of Worms (B3) and emptied. The purple
worms here can also be milked for their poison.
The two adult purple worms in the room are
restrained by adamantine chains. Three primordial
golems are currently collecting poison from one of the
purple worms. They will, however, immediately stop
work and attack any intruders. Even while restrained,
the purple worms are not completely harmless. Anyone
who comes within 10 feet of a worm's head will be the
target of a bite attack. Anyone who comes within 10 feet
of the other end of the worm will be targeted by a stinger
attack. Treat these as readied actions. Note that the
purple worms will not attack the golems.

B5. Feeding Chute


B7. Poison Chamber


In this room, the walls and floors are covered in a thick,
mucous slime that almost seems alive. The floor is
marked by strange engravings that look like a grid. On
opposite sides of the room are levers on the walls: one
lever is shaped like a worm, while the other is hornshaped. A shapeless humanoid figure stands in the
chamber next to the worm-shaped lever.


This is where the purple worm poison is kept until it is
needed. The Dumping Hall (B6) describes the effects of
being immersed in the poison.

B8. Chamber of the Guardian




This is where the purple worms are brought before
being dumped on the tarrasque as fodder. The wormshaped lever on the wall releases a dozen small purple
worms into this room. The other lever, shaped like a
horn, opens a trap door in the floor, which dumps the
worms into the tarrasque's chamber below.
One primordial golem waits in the room. When the
party reaches the room, the golem pulls the worm lever
to dump a dozen purple wormlings (same statistics as
giant poisonous snakes) onto the floor. The golem then
waits until someone enters the room. At this point, it
will move to pull the other lever and open the trap door.
Anyone standing on the trap door when it opens must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the
tarrasque pit below.

B6. Dumping Hall




This long hall has a strange floor. The floor appears to
have dozens of small holes, each with an iron covering.
At the far end of the hall, there is a circular metal door
with a small lever located beside it.


This strange room is the mechanism for waking the
tarrasque. When the tarrasque needs to be awakened,
a primordial golem opens the circular door. When the
circular door is opened, the entrance door slams shut
and locks. This causes the hall to fill with purple worm
venom in three rounds. The circular door automatically closes and locks after three rounds. All of the
locks require a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using
thieves' tools to open. The lever beside the door can be
used to open up the small holes in the floor. The poison
drains through the holes onto the tarrasque below and
awakens the gargantuan beast.
Anyone in the room when it is filling with poison will
take 1d6 poison damage per round. Anyone who drinks
or breathes in the poison (for example, with water
breathing) takes the full damage from purple worm
poison (12d6). Anyone with fewer than 75% of their hit
points remaining takes full damage from the second
round onwards, as the poison seeps into their wounds.





This chamber is dominated by an unearthly table
with several goblets on it, each filled with a purple
liquid. Sitting at the table is a faceless humanoid
dressed in a flowing cloak, and beside him are three
bronze constructs that are designed with his likeness.
The humanoid has a strange-looking talisman around
its neck.




This room is where the caretaker of the prison, an
ultroloth, can be found. Initially, he will not be hostile
to the heroes. Instead, one of his bronze automatons
will be used as a mouthpiece to communicate with the
heroes. The ultroloth is intelligent, and he understands
why the heroes have broken into the prison. He seeks to
be released from his bargain with Lutheria, so he is very
open about his desire to assist the heroes.
He is willing to tell the heroes how to awaken the
tarrasque but, in return, they must swear an oath to kill
Lutheria and bring her crystal scythe back to him. This
oath is a serious matter, and it will be enforced by the
erinyes of the Island of the Oathbreakers. If the heroes
are unwilling to swear the oath, then the ultroloth
expresses his profound disappointment in them. He
attacks with the help of his three bronze automatons.
The strange goblets are filled with purple worm
poison. The ultroloth has acquired a taste for the substance, and he is resistant to its effects. He won't stop
anyone from trying a drink for themselves, because he
would find it amusing to watch. The bronze automatons
are Sydon's gifts to him; the Titan wished to curry favor
with the ultroloth in case he ever needed to use one of
the weapons of the gods.
Treasure
The ultroloth wears a talisman of the sphere around his
neck. He uses this to control the sphere of annihilation
in the Chamber of Execution (B11).

B9. Golem Storage




Featureless humanoid golems stand silent and still
in a sad crowd at the center of this room. There are
a dozen of them. Some have missing arms, while a
couple have missing heads.




Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a

203

B11. Chamber of Execution

This is where damaged golems are repaired by the
ultroloth. None of them are operational, but the heroes
don't need to be told that they are broken. As far as the
party is concerned, the golems are merely unresponsive.



B10. Locking Chamber







This room is colder than the rest of the complex. There
are four huge floating spheres marked by ancient runes.
The walls are also covered in the same runes.




A large, two-foot wide black sphere floats at the very
center of this room. The sphere seems to absorb light.



The tarrasque can only be released from this room. Each
of the floating spheres has an ancient legend about the
tarrasque inscribed on it in the Primordial tongue. All
the stories are terrifying to anyone who can read them.
To open the cube, someone wearing the ultroloth's
talisman of the sphere (B8) must control the sphere of
annihilation (B11) so that it sits at the very center of the
room. The wearer of the talisman must then read aloud
the texts from each sphere. This causes them to spin.
Once all of the spheres are spinning, the bottom of the
cube will open, hundreds of feet below. The tarrasque
will be dumped into the Nether Sea, and the ancient
beast will then make its way to the surface of Thylea and
begin to wreak untold damage.



The sphere at the center of the room is a sphere of annihilation. The sphere is part of the ritual required to open
the Locking Chamber (B10) and release the tarrasque.
Killing the Tarrasque. The sphere also allows the
ultroloth to kill the tarrasque if needed. The ultroloth
must move the sphere to the top of the sleeping tarrasque's head and then send it through the creature's
brain. If the tarrasque is awake, this form of execution
is no longer possible, as the tarrasque will simply dodge
out of the way of the sphere.

B12. The Pit




A large pit looks down into a vast chamber that makes
up most of the iron cube's interior. Inside, a gargantuan
nightmarish creature slumbers. A thick, spiny brown
carapace covers the back of the immense reptile, which
resembles a predatory lizard with clawed forelimbs
slightly smaller than its legs. If the monster has eyes,
they are not clearly visible from your current position.

Releasing the Tarrasque



Releasing the tarrasque at this point in the adventure is
very unlikely. The ultroloth is the only creature who knows
the proper ritual, and he is unwilling to share this secret.

The tarrasque will remain sleeping unless it takes
damage or it is fed with purple worms. If awakened, it
will attack and attempt to consume anything in its pit.
If there is nothing to eat when it awakens, then the
tarrasque will angrily smash itself against the walls of
its prison. The resulting noise echoes across the entire
Nether Sea and attracts the attention of Lutheria. In this
case, she will sail to investigate the prison in her throne
ship, Hypnos. Only after 24 hours of angry activity will
the tarrasque grow tired of battering itself against the
walls of its prison and return to its slumber.

Lutheria despised her role as caretaker of the iron
cubes. I think she took pity on the creatures locked
within. Perhaps one day she will release them.
- Chondrus, Priest of Lutheria



Hypnos, Throne of Dreams
Hypnos is the domain of Lutheria, who is called the
Lady of Dreams and the Mistress of Death. Her throne
ship is a massive bronze ceremonial floating palace that
is pulled across the Nether Sea by her ancient sibling,
Talieus (LN empyrean). The enslaved Titan has been
blinded and his mouth has been sewn shut. The only
clean parts of his face are where tears have trickled
down from his ruined eye sockets. He now trudges on,
without rest or thanks, through the Nether Sea.
Lutheria's barge is a hanging garden that features
lush plants, vines, and trees. Fantastical flowers grow in
the garden, of almost every kind imaginable, and their
204

Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a

perfume almost drowns out the acidic smell of the Nether
Sea. Lutheria spends much of her time in her garden.
Beneath the garden is a network of tunnels and rooms
inhabited by Lutheria's servants. These spaces are lined
with tens of thousands of mortal skulls. Lutheria's
servants include lamias. These half-woman/half-lion
monstrosities are maenads that Lutheria has twisted
into a more powerful form. The lamias are served by
jackalwere, who were once male priests of Lutheria.
Their loyalty has been rewarded by being summoned
to the Lady's garden, where they are transformed into
creatures who can serve her better.

The Throne of Dreams
Events in Hypnos should have an otherworldly and
dream-like quality. Ideally, the heroes should feel a
kind of unease and distrust of everything that they
experience in Hypnos. They should never be quite sure
whether they are awake or in some sort of lucid dream
or nightmare.
Things in Lutheria's domain are not always quite what
they seem. Her servants may behave in irrational, dreamlike ways. Distances between parts of the vessel need
not always be consistent. For example, walking across
the ship's deck may seem like an endless journey of days
through a densely overgrown jungle.

General Features
• The ceilings are 15 ft. high unless otherwise noted.
• The doors are wooden unless otherwise noted.
• All of the rooms are lit by a permanent light spell.

KEY LOCATIONS
H1. Dreamer's Dock




You notice a small platform jutting from the side
of the bronze barge, just above the waterline. The
structure appears to be used as a dock, and may be
out of view from the main deck. Behind the platform
is the very faint outline of what might be a door into
the vessel.




The opening mechanism for the secret entrance can be
detected with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check. Behind the door is a small chamber. This is the
lair of a lamia and five jackalwere. They are lounging in
the small boats that float in the water of the chamber.
The lamia has used disguise self, and she looks like
a beautiful woman. The lamia will greet intruders by
kissing their hands. Anyone who allows this to happen
Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a

205

comes under the lamia's curse, and for the next hour,
they will have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.
The jackalwere are polymorphed into beautiful men
and women, and are currently smoking pipes of black
lotus. They invite anyone who enters the room to join
them for a smoke. The jackalwere will try to wait until a
majority of intruders have been cursed by the lamia. At
this point, they will use their sleep gaze and claim that the
party is drowsy from the effects of the lotus.
The jackalwere and lamia will defend themselves if
attacked. If they are able to put the entire party to sleep,
then they take them to The Kitchens (H8).

This is the home of the erinyes who are sent out to
capture oathbreakers in Thylea. There are usually two
erinyes here at any time, waiting to be called upon.
They are not hostile, but they will defend themselves.
The room has furniture from many worlds and times.
Treasure. The furnishings of this room are worth
about 10,000 gp in total, but attempting to remove even
a single piece will provoke the ire of the erinyes.

H4. Hall of Trinkets


H2. Dreamer's Halls




Underneath the lush greenery of the ship's deck, you
find yourselves in a series of long, dark hallways. The
walls and floor are lined with countless humanoid
skulls. The skulls stare at you with dead eyes.




The halls are empty. Whenever the heroes move
between rooms, the skulls appear to silently laugh at
them. Traversing the halls seems to take much longer
than the distances on the map would suggest. Each
minute spent in the hallways feels like hours.



H3. The Erinyes




This room is lavishly appointed. Each individual piece
of decor is breathtaking in its artistry, and the styles
are so varied that they combine to create an overall
impression of discordant opulence. Two women with
red-feathered wings are in the room. One polishes a
suit of heavy black armor while the other examines the
bowstring of a great longbow.




A doorway opens into a wide room lined with tall
marble plinths, each displaying a unique object.
Although many of the items are beautiful and unusual,
some appear quite mundane. The nearest item is a
writing quill with a brilliant orange plume that smolders like an ember. The next plinth supports a bright,
silver-colored mask, depicting the face of an elven
woman of unparalleled beauty.
Two small girls tend to this odd collection. One dusts
an ivory box while the other polishes a simple platinum
coin. The two girls possess unnaturally symmetrical
features. They move with a feline grace.

This gallery hall is where Lutheria stores some of the
magical trinkets that she has collected over the ages. She
doesn't collect items for their power or utility, but rather
because the items amuse her. All of the items rest on
marble plinths:

• A carved ivory music box. When this is opened, a





small turntable begins to move and the sounds of
wailing and screaming fill the air. The box holds the
souls of thousands of people from another world.
Their rulers made a pact with Powers from the Nine
Hells that their nation would rule the world for a
thousand years. Aftewards, all the native souls would
be the property of an archdevil. When the thousand
years ended, the nation's most powerful wizards tried
to protect the souls by binding them within the box,
and the souls have remained there for millennia, without physical form and driven to madness.
• An apple-sized dodecahedron forged from adamantine with strange, unreadable runes inscribed upon
it. This is the only remaining object from a world that
was swallowed by its sun.
• A mithral mask of a beautiful elven woman. The
wearer sees everything in the world in the most beautiful way imaginable, regardless of its reality.
• A platinum coin with the head of a dragon stamped
on one side and a dragon's tail on the other. The coin
doesn't radiate any magical aura, but it can be attuned.
Once attuned, the coin will always land on the face
that its owner wishes when it is flipped.

• A phoenix-feather writing quill. The quill was used

to write the Codex of the Infinite Planes. Anyone
writing with this quill always produces beautiful handwriting, and the writer can write in any language, even
languages they cannot speak or understand.

Two lamias guard this room, but they appear to be
young girls, and they claim to be sisters. They introduce
trespassers to their "toys," happily describing each item
to those who are curious. They drag visitors to each
plinth excitedly, but they warn against touching anything, because it makes Lutheria mad.
The lamia try to touch as many heroes as possible, holding their hands and pulling them around like
excited children. Anyone who is touched by the lamia is
affected by their intoxicating touch for 1 hour.
If any of the items are touched or taken, the two girls
will begin to shriek. Any jackalwere below deck will
come running and attack the intruders. When this happens, the lamia revert to their true forms and attack.

H5. Room of Nightmares




Although similar in size to most of the ship's other
chambers, the emptiness of this room makes it appear
much larger. There is a beautiful golden chair at the
center of the room. You have a feeling that sitting in
this chair will make your wildest dreams come true.


This room is used to break prisoners by bringing their
worst nightmares to life. Anyone sitting in the chair
activates the room's magic. The door vanishes and
the person in the chair becomes incapacitated for one
minute. During that time, a nightmare becomes manifest. The only way to stop the manifestation is to reduce
the dreamer's hit points to zero.
Roll on the Table of Nightmares, or have the player
whose character is in the chair choose which nightmare
is the worst from the list below. Do not tell them the
consequences before they make the choice.



This room appears to be an armory. It is guarded by
four wild-eyed men who ignore your arrival, muttering
incomprehensibly to themselves. Four items hang from
skeletal hands that emerge from the walls: a greataxe,
a greatsword, a shield, and a set of plate armor.

Four jackalwere guard this room, disguised as gibbering madmen. They leave intruders alone unless
someone touches the weapons or armor on display.
Whenever an item is touched, the jackalwere grow

Weapons of Madness
The weapons and armor displayed in this room contain
portions of Lutheria's ancient madness. Sydon once
attempted to cure his sister's insanity by drawing it out
like a poison. He forged this psychic energy into the
magic items in this room. They are: plate mail of vulnerability, berserker greataxe, shield of missile attraction, and a greatsword of vengeance.
Anyone touching one of these cursed items for the
first time must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or contract a short-term madness (see Madness
in the 5th Edition Game Master's Guide). Heroes that
succeed on this saving throw are immune to the effects
from that point forward.
Using the Weapons. Lutheria has disadvantage on
attack rolls versus characters who are wielding one of
these items. If an attack from one of these weapons
hits Lutheria, or if she hits someone wearing the armor
with her scythe, then the cursed item is destroyed, and

she is immediately overwhelmed by the ancient madness that was bound within the item. Whenever this
happens, Lutheria suffers the effects of the confusion
spell until the end of her next turn.

H7. Scrying Room




Two strange women sit in this room, with their backs
to the door. Both women have the lower bodies of
lions. Each of these creatures stares intently into a
looking glass. The mirrors display apparently random
scenes from all over Thylea. The images flicker through
too quickly for you to take in specific details.




Several scrawny dog-like men scurry about this kitchen,
preparing sumptuous foods. They are ordered around
by a monstrous woman with the lower body of a lion.
You can smell something delicious cooking, but many
of the meat dishes include shanks of suspiciously
humanoid body parts.




The women are two lamias. They use the mirrors
to watch all the lands of Thylea, and they make daily
reports to Lutheria. They are proud of this task, and
they are happy to explain it to the heroes.
The lamias attempt to touch the heroes during their
explanation. They may try to show the heroes something disturbing, such as King Acastus plotting against
them-or the massive fleet that Sydon has gathered. Once
they have touched the heroes, the lamias summon all the
remaining jackalwere on this deck and attack the party.
Each of the mirrors is attuned to a lamia, and they will
not work when anyone else attempts to use them.



This is where feasts are prepared for Lutheria and her
guests. A single lamia supervises the work of three
jackalwere. None of them have the time to disguise
their true forms, as they are always busy preparing the
next meal. When meals are ready, they are taken up to
Lutheria's Garden (H10) and served.
Captured Heroes. Heroes who have been captured by
the jackalwere's sleep ability will awaken here, trussed up
and ready for the oven. Spellcasters will have an apple
shoved into their mouths.

H9. Sleeping Chamber




This chamber is dimly lit by a single torch. There are
five beds here, each occupied by a sleeping form.




This chamber is where Lutheria's servants sleep. Two
male dryads and three female satyrs are asleep here.
They are consorts to the jackalwere. If awakened, they
will be frightened, but they will not fight.

H10. Lutheria's Garden




This entire vessel is covered with lush greenery that
obscures details of its deck and hides any crew who
might be on board. This strange garden's vibrant
colors stand out in stark contrast against the murky
grays of the Nether Sea. A chaotic mix of scents-
pleasant, revolting, and exotic-drift from the abundant flora.


This garden is full of exotic plants from all over the
multiverse, and Lutheria has carefully chosen ones that
are beautiful, produce intoxicating scents, or that bear
fruits that can be used for wines or narcotics. Many of
these plants seem revolting to the eyes and to the nose,
but Lutheria's sensibilities and tastes are unlike those of
common mortals.
Any hero who eats fruit or deliberately takes in the
flowers' scents may be overcome in some way, as shown
on the table opposite.

excess-for her most devoted servants. Lutheria does
not immediately attack those who trespass in her
garden. She will first satisfy her curiosity and seek to
entertain herself by telling jokes, playing games, and
toying with her prey.

Confronting Lutheria
Read the following when the heroes meet Lutheria:


Lutheria



This courtyard is filled with goatlings and fey creatures
engaged in drunken revelry. At the center of the crowd,
a beautiful giant-sized woman lounges on an ornate
throne. Most of the revelers are so intoxicated that
they fail to notice your presence, but the black-eyed
woman immediately locks eyes with you.
"Ah, the heroes of the prophecy. I suppose you have
come to kill me. That would be very boring. Wouldn't
you prefer to join the festivities?"
Despite the cup of wine in her hand, the woman's
voice remains sober, but her eyes brim with madness.




There are many ways that the encounter with Lutheria
can play out, depending upon the actions of the heroes.

The Bacchanal
The garden is filled with Lutheria's servants, all of whom
are engaged in debauchery and drunken revelry. The
participants include two lamias, two satyr minstrels,
and seven goatlings. All but Lutheria are drunk (they
have the poisoned condition).
Lutheria's servants urge the heroes to join in the revelry, forcing drinks into their hands and trying to entice
Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a

209

them with sensual words. But joining the revelry is, in
effect, a death sentence by poisoning.
Heroes who drink the wine must succeed on a DC 16
Constitution saving throw or else they become poisoned
and abandon their senses. While participating in the
revelry, they take 1d6 psychic damage each round. In
order to regain control of themselves, the heroes must
make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
Refusing to join in has no immediate consequences.
Lutheria turns a withering gaze upon each person in the
heroes' party, then tosses back her drink and ignores
them. Your players should feel uneasy about their refusal
to join-it's not wise to spoil Lutheria's fun.
Attacking Lutheria will cause all her servants to abandon their revelry and rush to her defense, even though
they are drunk and effectively poisoned.

The Royal Game
The heroes may challenge Lutheria to the game of
twenty squares. Lutheria loves the game, but she rarely
gets to play it, because she has a habit of killing anyone
who beats her at it.


Lutheria's Joke
Lutheria is unwilling to discuss anything until she's had
a chance to test the heroes.




"Wait-before we discuss business, allow me to break
the ice. Although you are shameless trespassers, I feel
obligated to entertain you."




Lutheria deadpans the following jokes. With each joke,
the entire entourage bursts into a chorus of laughter. Lutheria does not laugh. She watches the heroes
intently, gauging their reaction.

• What is the most disgusting thing imaginable?
>>A bag full of dead mortal children.

• And what is more disgusting than that?
>>One at the bottom is still wriggling.

• What's the difference between an onion and an
innocent mortal child?
>>I cry when I chop up an onion.

It should be clear to your players that they are actually
expected to laugh out loud at these jokes. If anyone
refuses to laugh, Lutheria becomes irate. She points at
each hero who failed to laugh and berates them.




Lutheria's points at you accusingly, and her eyes
burn into the back of your skull. "You there. Why
didn't you laugh? Are you bored? Am I boring to you?
Answer me!"


On the other hand, if the heroes humor Lutheria by
laughing at her jokes, then she applauds their sense of
humor. This puts her in a better mood to bargain.

210

Ch apter 7 - The Nether Se a





Lutheria's eyes light up, and she makes a gesture with
her hand. The deck in front of her throne shimmers and
becomes a board of twenty black-and-white squares.
"It has been much too long since someone has had
the courage to challenge me to the Royal Game! But
what shall we wager? Oh, I know!"
With another wave of her hand, Lutheria summons
seven goatlings to stand in the board's starting row.
Then she waves her hand again, and seven of your
comrades from the Ultros appear opposite them. They
stand completely still, as if paralyzed.
"We shall wager the lives of our servants." The goddess grins and strokes her crystal scythe.




Before the game begins, three winged forms set down on
the deck to watch the game. These are the Furies from the
Room of Far Sight (S33). They have come to enforce the
rules of the game and prevent anyone from backing out
prematurely. This annoys Lutheria, but she has no choice
but to accept it. If the players become hostile or uncooperative, the Furies summon seven erinyes for backup and
banish the heroes to the Island of the Oathbreakers (N5).
Playing the Game. Refer to the game of twenty
squares entry in the Treasures appendix for details about
the rules of the game. Lutheria uses an ancient rule that
has been forgotten by mortals: since the heroes challenged her to the game, she has the right to determine
the wager. The Furies agree to this.
Lutheria's Strategy. Lutheria loves the game almost
as much as she hates losing. Over the centuries, she
has devised a way of cheating without detection. When
she fails one of the opposed skill rolls, she may spend
one of her uses of legendary resistance to automatically
win the roll instead. All of Lutheria's rolls should be
hidden behind the GM screen. Heroes with high passive
Perception scores may notice her cheating, but the
Furies are incapable of detecting it.
Lutheria is unsportsmanlike during the game. She
gloats when she wins a round and sulks when she loses.
She becomes increasingly agitated when she's losing.
She may go so far as to expend all three uses of legendary resistance in order to ensure her own victory.
Lutheria Loses. If the heroes win the match, then
Lutheria loses her temper. She slaughters all seven of the
goatlings that served as her pieces. The goddess is now
in a terrible mood and may attack unprovoked.
Lutheria Wins. If the heroes lose the match, then
Lutheria is absolutely delighted. She slaughters all seven

of the Ultros crew that served as their pieces. The Furies
ensure that the wager is honored before departing. The
goddess is now in an excellent mood and is willing to
grant each of the heroes a boon.

Renewing the Oath
If the heroes ask Lutheria to renew her commitment to
the Oath of Peace, then she will agree to do so under one
condition: the entire party must swear an indefinite oath
of service to her. The heroes would be required to do
essentially anything she asks for the rest of their lives, as
if under the effects of an unbreakable geas spell.
Terms of the Oath. Lutheria agrees not to harm any
of the mortal cities of Thylea. Her temples would remain
standing, and she would still require sacrifices, but
things would continue much as they have been.
Lutheria has no interest in her husband's schemes.
The heroes would still be free to assail Praxys and battle
Sydon or negotiate with him separately. She will not
interfere with these tasks. She agrees not to demand
anything of the players until after they have dealt with
her husband (after the Battle of Mytros).

Attacking Lutheria

Epic Paths: Confronting Lutheria
If the Doomed One is present, Lutheria spends the first
round in combat laughing uncontrollably at the lifetime
of misfortune that she inflicted on them. If the Haunted
One is present, Lutheria realizes that she's made a mistake and concentrates all her efforts on killing them.
The Haunted One needs to destroy Lutheria's scythe in
order to release the souls of their lost family. Refer to the
Running the Epic Paths section for details.

Defeating Lutheria

If the heroes provoke a battle with Lutheria, whether
by attacking her or by annoying her too much, read the
following:


The heroes are immediately attacked by all of the
creatures participating in the bacchanal. Lutheria joins
the battle after one round, gleefully inflicting as much
damage as she can with her scythe. She loudly orders
her minions to torture and crucify the heroes.
This battle should be very difficult, and it should force
the heroes to expend all of their resources. You might
need to bring in reinforcements from elsewhere in
Hypnos in order to increase the challenge. You may also
choose to have Lutheria summon undead servants, such
as wights and ghosts, to assist in the battle.

If the heroes fight and defeat Lutheria read the following:


Lutheria collapses to her knees, grasping at the air
in front of you. She unleashes a screeching wail of
anguish, refusing to believe that a band of mere
mortals has defeated her. Her body slowly transforms
into a strange, twisting light. The light explodes into a
storm of cosmic matter-and then she vanishes.



"You mortals always disappoint me."
The Lady of Dreams appears affected by a deep sadness. Black tears roll down her face. The garden wilts,
and all of her servants begin to weep and wail. Minutes
pass, and the mournful scene continues. You feel a chill
run down your spine.
Finally, Lutheria ostentatiously dries her eyes. Her
face breaks into a wicked smile. "Well. I need some
cheering up. Let's start by tearing your pathetic little
bodies apart, limb from limb."

Chapter 8:

Praxys, Tower of Sydon
"When first we sailed into Thylea from the
Old World, we did not know that we were trespassers. But then we saw the great Tower, its red
light glaring at us from miles away. And we knew
that we had stumbled into the realm of the gods."

T

-Yoshua, from the Annals of the Settlers

he tower of Praxys is the oldest and
tallest structure in Thylea. It is one of the few
remaining landmarks from the time when gods
walked among mortals, and the dragons and
giants fought for primacy. Praxys serves as the throne of
Sydon, the Lord of Storms. He uses it as a guard tower
to watch for incursions from the outer world. The Titan
has modified and rebuilt the tower over many centuries,
and thousands of cyclopes and gygan workers have died
to fashion his "palace."
Sydon is often found at Praxys, surrounded by his
sons and daughters. Although Sydon and Lutheria
have come to hate one another in recent centuries, the
twins bore these young empyrean children together in
anticipation of the end of the Oath of Peace. Sydon has
trained them to reclaim the powers of the Five Gods.

212

Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

Traveling to the Tower
Traveling to Praxys should be an ordeal. If the party has
not yet encountered Sydon's Fleet, then they should do
so on the voyage here. Otherwise, you may choose to
run 1-2 random sea encounters during the voyage.
Read the following when the party arrives:




After days of sailing into the far reaches of the ocean,
the weather turns rough. Powerful storm waves
threaten to overturn your ship, rocking it from side to
side, and a thick blanket of fog obscures the sea around
you. The wreckage of broken ships drifts past your
prow, and you begin to wonder whether you will share
the fates of their unfortunate crews.
Eventually, you notice a beam of light, which seems
to sweep the surrounding seas from an immense
height. Massive rocks emerge from the fog: the foundations of a gargantuan stone tower. Your ship suddenly feels very exposed-tiny and vulnerable next to
the impossible size of the structure which now looms
above you. This can only be the Tower of Sydon.




THE TOWER

Praxys is a great tower of stone, which breaks upward
through a headland of limestone. It is massive in size,
beyond any human scale, towering more than 1,500 feet
into the air. It was carved from a small mountain that
rose out of the ocean. The tower is 200 feet across, and
its interior is filled with vast empty spaces that serve
as storage chambers and prisons. Only three floors are
designed to be habitable by mortal creatures, and each
of these floors have ceilings that are 30 ft. in height, in
order to accommodate Titans and giants.
Across many miles of ocean, Sydon's tower projects
a piercing ray of silver light, which searches for trespassers. This light radiates from the heart of a star that
Sydon has imprisoned at the pinnacle of the tower.
A huge stone dock juts out to the south. It was built
for ships manned by gygans or cyclopes, not for human
vessels. The dock is protected by a dozen ballista crewed
by gygans. Each gygan can load, aim and fire its ballista
in a single round due to their size and six arms.
Defensive Ballistae
Ballista Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range:
120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d10 + 2) piercing damage.



This massive stone tower must be at least 1,500 feet
tall. There is a large stone dock on the south side of
the tower, which appears to be incredibly ancient,
possibly thousands of years old. It stands strong
against the abuses of the waves and weather, and
a foreboding air surrounds the place. Birds wheel
around the heights of the tower but, as the scale of
the place hits home, you realize that they are not
seagulls. The "birds" are distant griffons, each the size
of a horse. The massive double doors at the base of the
tower appear nigh-impenetrable.


The double adamantine doors are 40 ft. tall and cannot
be damaged. They are barred from the other side. They
can be forced open by characters with a combined
Strength of 200 or more; no check is necessary if the
group are strong enough, but no more than a dozen
humans can attempt the task at once. If the heroes lack
the combined strength, they will have to find another
way in-through the flooded basement.
The griffons flying around the tower nest in many
places on ledges and in window openings. They are
aggressive towards anyone who tries to approach the
tower by air. Someone using flight will be swarmed by 7

Gaining Entry to the Tower
There are three obvious ways to gain entry to the tower.

• The Front Gate. A direct assault on the main dock

and gate is probably the most difficult. The gygans
fire their ballistae as soon as approaching ships come
within range. Once the gygans are dealt with, the main
doors must somehow be opened. A direct assault
almost certainly puts the tower on alert status.
• From the Sky. Approaching from the air is difficult
due to the griffons. But if the heroes are able to make
it past the griffons, then they will have easy access to
areas S9 and S26. All other windows in the tower are
permanent walls of force.
• Underwater. The easiest approach is underwater.
Anyone sailing around the tower will notice pipes
located just below the water level. These pipes are
large enough for Medium-sized creatures to make
their way into the tower. The pipes provide access to
areas S5, S10, S19, and S22.

Traveling Through the Tower

Arrival at the Tower


(2d6) griffons. In addition, the Fallen Star (S37) illuminates any flying creatures trying to gain access. If the
first group of griffons are defeated, the light summons
another swarm after 2d6 rounds.



There are many different methods to travel up and
down within the tower. At its center is a spiral staircase
that climbs from ground level all the way to the tower's
summit. The staircase was built for giants, so a humansized creature will find the constant climbing rather
exhausting. Some levels are connected by a cleverly
constructed elevator that was built when Sydon still
possessed the divine power of artifice.
Bronze Pipes. Huge bronze pipes run from the underwater basement and feed water to all of the floors, and
sometimes aquatic creatures use these pipes. They swim
with the current in the pipes to move about the tower.
Griffon Mounts. The griffons that roost on the
window ledges of the tower could potentially be used
as mounts by anyone intrepid enough to figure out how
to tame them. Although the griffons are monstrosities,
they can be targeted with animal friendship and other
spells that target beasts. Mounting a charmed griffon
requires someone in the party to make a successful DC
18 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

General Features of Praxys
The ceilings are 30 ft. high unless otherwise noted.
Bronze Doors. The doors are bronze unless otherwise
noted. There are three types of doors. The small doors
are 5 ft. wide and 10 ft. high. The large doors are 10 ft.
wide and 25 ft. high. The double doors are each 5 ft.
wide and 25 ft. high. Opening a large or double door is
easy for large creatures. Medium and smaller creatures

must use an action, and opening the doors requires a

Driftglobes. All of the rooms are lit by a single driftglobe that emanates light using the light spell. Unlike
the standard light spell, this light lasts for 8 hours
before ending. All of the inhabitants of Praxys know the
command word for the driftglobes. If the driftglobes are
taken from the tower, they cease to be magical.
Deafening Forge. The sound of distant furnaces,
hammering, and machinery can be heard throughout
the tower. On the Forge level these sounds are loudest,
but on the other levels it can still be heard as ambient
background noise. The sound makes it difficult for
tower inhabitants to hear the sounds of battle in rooms
that are close by. The DC for all Perception checks to
listen are also increased by 5.
Forbiddance. Each floor of the tower is protected by
a permanent forbiddance spell. The forbiddance for one

floor can be cancelled by a dispel magic at DC 19. The
forbiddance makes teleporting into the tower or using
magical gates or ethereal travel to gain entry impossible.
Sydon, his children, and any yugoloth in the tower know
the password to ignore the forbiddance.

The Inhabitants of Praxys
Many creatures live within the Tower. Some spend their
entire lives inside and never actually bother with the
outside world. The tower inhabitants go about their
daily activities as described in each room or chamber
description, unless the tower is alerted.
Alerting the Tower. When they are attacked, gygans,
minotaurs, and centaurs will send one of their number
to the central stair to alert the tower. If the horn on the
central stair is sounded, the tower moves to an alert
status. At this point, creatures will take the actions
described in the Inhabitants of Praxys table.

216

Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

Event: March of the Titans
At any time, you may choose to have Sydon deploy a full
detachment of his army from the Heavens down to the
docks. Sydon has been sending his soldiers down each
day to join his gathering war fleet. The full detachment
consists of 240 gygans, 10 gygan heroes, 24 minotaurs,
and 8 minotaur heroes-all armed for war.
The detachment marches down the stairs, stopping at
each level to rest and give prayer to Sydon. It takes four

hours for them to reach the lowest level. They will only
stop if they are directly attacked. Otherwise, they ignore
what is happening on the levels-they know that Sydon
and his children will deal with intruders.
You can use this event to close off the main stairway
in order to force the heroes to find another route to
the upper levels. You can also use it to foreshadow the
looming conflict in the Battle of Mytros.

The Basement
Water Pumps

This underwater complex is where water is pumped
into the rest of the tower. Sewage and waste is also
disposed of through here. Spotting the inlet and outlet
pipes from the deck of the Ultros is a trivial task.
Anyone who briefly searches the shoreline will see
them in the water.



Water Intakes




Bronze pipes draw water from the ocean directly into
the tower. Each pipe is five feet in diameter and is
located just below the water level.




This pipe is where water is drawn from the ocean into
the Water Pumps chamber (see below). The current is
gentle and constant, making this an easy pathway into
the tower. The heroes only need to hold their breath to
be drawn through, and the pipes are large enough to
allow a centaur-sized creature to pass.

Sewage expulsion




Murky water surrounds several bronze pipes at the
base of the tower. These pipes spew a constant
stream of sewage into the ocean.


This is where sewage is expelled from the tower. It is
possible to enter the tower through this outflow, but as
the pumped water is flowing outward, it is not ideal.
A successful DC 15 Strength check is necessary to
battle through the artificial current. In addition, the
pipes are fouled by centuries of filth, and are now home
to a half-dozen gibbering mouthers who occupy the
seaward end of the pipe, feeding on everything that
flushes through it. These hideous creatures will attack
anything that enters their lair. Traveling all the way up
these pipes leads to the Waste Room (S22).



The bronze pipe leads into a large circular chamber
dominated by an intricate system of machinery that
pumps water into two large pipes that extend down
from the ceiling. The machines are operated by several
one-eyed aquatic humanoids.







The chamber is 40 ft. in diameter with a 10 ft. ceiling.
A doorway on the opposite side of the room leads to a
sea hag's lair (The Bowl). This room is where water is
pumped up into the higher floors of the structure-no
trivial job, given the height of the tower. The machinery
is also imbued with some ancient magic that removes
most of the salt from seawater.
Bronze Pipes. There are two bronze pipes in the
ceiling, each 5 ft. in diameter. The first pipe pumps
water to rooms S5 and S10 of the tower. The second
pipe pumps water to room S19 of the tower. These
pipes are large enough to allow Medium-sized creatures to swim through them. Swimming through them
becomes more difficult if the pumps fail, but it's still
possible.
Merrow Tribe. A tribe of one-eyed merrow operate
the pumps, and all have the poor depth perception trait
typical of cyclopes, because they only have one eye. The
merrow have disadvantage on any attack roll against a
target more than 30 feet away. There are eight of them
in this chamber, but they are too busy to worry about
trespassers. However, they will defend themselves if
attacked, and they will answer the sea hag's call, if she
summons them to The Bowl.

The Bowl




Beyond the pump room is a bowl-shaped chamber.
Aquatic weeds hang from the ceiling, blocking your
view. The floor is flooded with bitterly-cold water.


Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

This room is 30 feet in diameter. A bowl of water elemental control is embedded in the floor in the center of
this room. An ancient sea hag lives here, and the entire
basement is considered to be her lair.
Once the hag is aware of intruders, she uses a lair
action to create illusory simulacrums of the heroes out
of weed and refuse. She will use these simulacrums
to distract and tease the heroes, but she won't openly
attack. The hag is a lonely coward, and if the heroes
threaten her, she quickly surrenders. If questioned, she
explains how the bronze pipes can be used to traverse
the tower and reach the higher floors.
If she is attacked, she will use the water elemental

from the bowl to defend herself, and she will summon
the eight merrow from the Water Pumps chamber.
Lair Actions. On initiative count 20, the sea hag can
take a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

• The sea hag can create a simulacrum out of weed and

refuse. The simulacrum can be of any creature currently in her lair. The simulacrum lasts for one minute
and obeys every command of the hag. She can only
have one simulacrum at a time.
• The sea hag can cast the mislead spell. If the hag's
illusion is the target of a spell or attack, it melts into a
puddle of oily black residue.

Entrance Level
The main entrance to the tower is protected by adamantine gates, powerful spell wards, and an entire detachment of gygan soldiers. However, if the main doors can
be opened by force, then the party can enter the tower
through this massive antechamber.




Once the doors are forced open, you enter a vast, open
space with ceilings reaching 100 feet high. You stand
on a wide stone bridge that leads to a massive stairwell
at the center of the chamber. Below the bridge, the
chamber is filled with a lake of dark, murky water.




A 20 ft. wide bridge leads to the central staircase that
ascends all the way to the top level of the tower. The
staircase was built for huge creatures, and even gygans

treat the stairs as difficult terrain. Fifty feet below the
bridge, the central shaft disappears beneath the water.
Three huge bronze pipes run upward along the walls.
Six gygans and one gygan hero guard the entrance
chamber. They can see outside through a one-foot
diameter bronze spyhole in the door, which can be
opened and closed. The gygans will only open the doors
for gygans who know the password ("Hergeron")-or for
Sydon or one of his empyrean children.
The water is home to a giant shark. The gygans feed
the shark once a day with a chum bucket (which may be
a clue for the heroes that something lurks in the pool). In
combat the gygans will use their grapple ability and try
to toss injured enemies into the water, to be eaten by the
shark. Due to the murkiness of the water, the shark gains
advantage against anyone who doesn't have blindsight.

The Chamber Levels
Between the main levels of the tower, there are three
chamber levels. The chamber levels have 100 ft. ceilings
and they are mostly empty. The central staircase passes
through the middle of each of these chambers, and
adamantine chains anchor the stair at regular intervals.
Bronze piping runs vertically through the chambers,
connecting the Water Pumps to the upper floors.

Chamber Level 1: The Titan




The walls around the staircase seem like nothing
you've ever encountered-a firm but supple material. Touching the fleshy walls provokes a feeling of
unease. Worse than that is the smell: a putrid aroma
fills the air.


Sydon thinks he's so great and powerful, living
at the top of his giant tower. What do you

think he's compensating for, eh? Pythor needs
no such tower! Anyway, I bet my little statue
in Mytros could smash that place to rubble.

-Pythor, God of Battle

218

This is where Hergeron (CN elder empyrean), the
Titan, has been imprisoned by Sydon. Unlike the other
chambers, this one is only 10 feet in height. Hergeron
lies naked and twisted in a half circle around the stairs.
His legs are pinned to the floor by adamantine spikes
that run from the floor to the ceiling. The empyrean is
now completely insane, and this can only be cured by
a wish spell. He is also trapped by powerful magic, and
only another wish spell can free him.

Gygans. Every day, a party of six gygans arrives at
dawn, noon, and dusk to collect food for The Kitchens
(S13). They attack trespassers without hesitation.

If the party speaks to him, Hergeron is almost entirely
incomprehensible and obviously in great pain. However,
it's clear that he's trying to communicate something of
great importance to the party. Some of the intelligible
phrases that he speaks are like riddles:

Chamber Level 3: The Prisons

• Take the flame from the silver star and lure its dying,



forgotten love away from the celestial sea!
• Sydon has twisted the dragons into something
wretched-the silver mother will not forgive him!



Your senses are assaulted as you enter this huge
chamber. All around you are prison cages hanging
from chains. The prisoners inside are tormented by the
wailing songs of harpies that nest in the walls of this
vast room. Between the sound and smell of the harpies
and the pitiful whimpering of the prisoners, this prison
is a nightmarish place. The central stairway continues
upward for 100 feet, vanishing into the ceiling.

If someone casts a 3rd level or higher healing spell on
Hergeron, it will take away his pain and calm him for
a few minutes. In this case, he is coherent enough to
answer questions. He has a vast memory, and he knows
much about what is happening in the tower. Asking him
questions is equivalent to casting a commune spell.





This prison for Sydon's captives echoes with the hopeless
cries of prisoners, and the melodious, seductive singing of
harpies. There are ten cube-shaped cages hanging from
the ceiling at various heights. You may choose which prisoners to put in the cages. Here are some suggestions:

Hergeron's Cryptic Words
Hergeron's riddles refer to the Fallen Star (S37), and the
clone of Balmytria in the Dragon's Chamber (S25). If his
pain can be eased, then he will explain the riddles.

• Any NPC from the Dramatis Personae appendix that
the heroes have yet to meet on their travels.

Chamber Level 2: The Freezer


• Crew members from the Ultros who have been taken


Your breath freezes and your teeth chatter as you enter
this chamber. A thick layer of ice coats everything in
sight. The central stair continues upwards, but this is
clearly where food is stored to keep it from spoiling.




This is a freezer for perishable foods. Everything in
this 100-foot-tall chamber is coated in ice. Bare skin
instantly sticks to objects in this room, so the party
should be careful touching things or walking barefoot.
Peeling away stuck hands or feet requires an action and
causes 1d4 cold damage.
Storage Platforms. The adamantine chains connected
to the central stair are coated in ice. The tops of the icy
chains have been smoothed and can be used as paths to
reach the walls. Platforms have been carved into the ice
walls and are stacked with barrels, slabs of meats and
fish, casks of wine, crates of grain, and many other foodstuffs. Ladders have been carved into the ice to allow the
tower's inhabitants to climb up and down to different
platforms to reach the stores.

There was a time when Lutheria shared the throne of Praxys
with her husband, and the tower was said to be a place
of great beauty. But eventually, the Lady of Dreams grew
bored with her insipid twin and began to play practical jokes
on him. Sydon once demanded a chorus of voices be raised
to celebrate the forging of his glaive. Lutheria captured
hundreds of sirens and brought them before the throne...

prisoner by Sydon's children and servants while the
heroes have been busy exploring the tower.
• A selection of Amazon warriors, Mytrosian sailors,
and long-neglected dead prisoners.

Terrifying Nest of Harpies
Three dozen harpies have been encouraged to nest
along the walls. They torment the living prisoners with
songs, but they ignore anyone traveling up the central
stairway. If someone tries to interfere with the harpies
or their prisoners, then the harpies will attack. They
have significant advantages due to their numbers.
The harpies use their luring song on trespassers, and
each trespasser will be targeted by 1d6 harpies. Each
hero must make a saving throw against each song at
disadvantage. The harpies fly close to the ceiling, so
that if someone throws themselves from the stairs to
reach them due to the luring song, that creature will fall
and take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage. Anyone who
falls will be attacked by a dozen harpies with advantage
on their claw and bite attacks. If half of the harpies are
killed, then the surviving harpies will flee through a
small hole in the wall and roost outside the tower.

...demanding that they sing for her husb
and. They sang
for days on end, until their voices wer
e raw. When at
last their voices gave out, they began
to transform into
hideous harpies. Sydon has never forg
iven his sister for
infesting his tower with the loathsome
creatures, but
Lutheria still laughs about it to this
day.

The Forge
The forge is used by cyclopes and gygans to build weapons, armor, automatons, and golems for Sydon's coming
war against the mortals of Thylea.

Wandering Monsters
The heroes may randomly encounter 1d4 blemys or
gygans in the halls of the Forge. Use these creatures as
reinforcements to challenge the party.

S1. The Forge Room




This room seems to be an ancient forge. The air is
stiflingly hot from the hearth, and heavy iron tools are
scattered around. A cyclops and several strange insectmen are hunched over the hearth, hard at work.




Garzoon (CE jancan mage) works at the forge, building
weapons, golems, and constructs. He has gone slightly
mad from centuries of overwork, but he's still one of the
finest smiths in all of Thylea. He has enough of his wits
remaining to trade the password to The Treasury (S14)
in the event that this life is threatened.
Garzoon is assisted by twelve advanced myrmekes;
they are effective servants due to their intellect and ability to learn quickly. They are also utterly loyal, because
Sydon keeps their queen as a prisoner. Garzoon attacks
trespassers in his forge, and the myrmekes assist him.
If Garzoon is defeated, the myrmekes will immediately stop attacking and then ask the heroes to free their
queen. They speak telepathically, but their minds are
so alien that no other thoughts can be understood. The
myrmekes will not aid the heroes in any way, even by
giving out information about the tower, because they
fear Sydon's potential retaliation on their queen.
The Bronze Trap. At the center of the room is a
giant-sized lever that can be pulled to trigger the trap
in the Iron Saddle (S7), if it hasn't yet been triggered. If
the trap has been triggered already, then the lever can
be pulled to unblock the door by raising the adamantine
block via a pulley system in the ceiling. Pulling the lever
requires a combined Strength of 20.
The Windows. The windows in this room are permanent walls of force which cannot be dispelled.

S2. Garzoon's Chambers




This room is dominated by a giant-sized bed, a chest,
dresser, and nightstand. The room is neat and orderly,
and very unlike the living chambers of most cyclopes.
Everything seems to be precisely arranged.

S11. Myrmekes Queen
S12. Gygan Barracks
S13. The Kitchens
S14. The Treasury

This is where Garzoon the cyclops sleeps and lives. He
keeps his clothes and money in here, but his most prized
possessions are in The Treasury (S14). His room is neat
and tidy so that he can immediately tell if anyone has
touched his things-a sign of his madness. He believes
that he is being watched all the time-by everyone!
Garzoon's Journal. On the nightstand is the giantsized journal where Garzoon records his thoughts (in
the Giant language). Anyone reading the journal will
quickly realize that Garzoon is paranoid and slightly
insane. He trusts no one, and he hints at a secret treasury that no one knows about-not even Sydon.
The journal makes it obvious that Sydon is pushing
Garzoon hard to prepare an army to conquer the people
of Mytros. Garzoon loves to forge weapons and armor,
but he's a perfectionist who hates to be rushed. His journal includes fantasy scenarios where he quits and Sydon
is forced to beg him to come back.
Treasure
The chest at the foot of the bed contains 15,000 sp and
3,000 gp. Many of the coins are very ancient and depict
six-armed cyclopes wearing laurel crowns.

S3. Myrmekes Den




There is a dark, inhuman feel to this room. Large slimy
egg-things are arranged along the walls, almost like
beds. Inside these strange pods, twelve strange, winged
insect-men are apparently resting.




This chamber is the lair of the advanced myrmekes.
There are usually a dozen myrmekes resting up at any
given time. They are not hostile unless provoked, and
they will communicate telepathically with anyone who
enters their lair peacefully. A certain caution on the part
of visitors is acceptable; open aggression is not.
The myrmekes explain that they are Sydon's unwilling
servants, because their queen is being held prisoner. The
myrmekes will beg the heroes to free their queen and
help them regain their freedom. Once the queen is safe,
the myrmekes are quite clear that they will do anything
possible to assist the heroes.

S4. The Bronze Pipes


S6. The Elevator




These cramped bronze pipes transfer water from level
to level. Swimming through them is a cramped and
unpleasant experience.




The bronze pipes provide water to all but the top most
tower levels. Six water weirds patrol the pipes to keep
them clean. For every 10 minutes spent in the pipes
by any group of heroes, there is a 25% chance of being
attacked by two of the water weirds. The party needs
some form of waterbreathing in order to traverse the
pipes without drowning.
The pipes take water to The Water Wheels (S5) and
to the Golem Workshop (S10). A tiny-sized creature can
access a pipe leading to the Kitchens (S13). The pipes
also carry water further up the tower, and the heroes can
use them to reach The Baths (S19).

S5. The Water Wheels




Large bronze pipes gush water onto the wheels
that power various pieces of machinery in here. The
contents of this room are squeezed in tightly, leaving
little room for the two groaning, headless giants who
apparently maintain the machinery.




The huge water wheels power much of the machinery
on this tower level. The two blemys do the necessary
work to keep the machinery running. They have very
little room to move about the cramped chamber, but
they fight to the death anyway.
Bronze Pipes. This room can be accessed via the
network of bronze pipes that runs through the tower
(see The Bronze Pipes, S4). Anyone entering the room
through the pipes must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from
the wheels. The pipes can be entered with a successful
DC 20 Strength check to fight through the current of
outflowing water. The water drains at the bottom of
the wheel, but there is only enough room for a creature
of tiny size to squeeze through. The drains lead to the
sewage pipes and eventually the ocean.
Secret Door. The entrance leading to The Treasury
(S14) is concealed in the southern wall by dirt and oil. It
can be detected with a passive Perception check of 15,
or by an active search (no check required).

Praxys is truly a marvel of ingenuity. The tower must be
thousands of years old, and yet we have nothing like it in
Mytros or Estoria. I'm sure that my father would love to
have a chance to examine the interior...



This magnificent bronze elevator is large enough for
a giant, and it offers plenty of room for human-sized
creatures to stand comfortably. The bronze etchings on
the walls and floor are intricate and beautiful.




The bronze elevator is a moving room that can take
anyone up to the next level of the tower. It is guarded
and operated by one gygan who will attack anyone who
doesn't look like an inhabitant of the tower. The elevator
can be used to access The Heavens (S17).
Activating the Elevator. A bell hangs down from a
large hook and is obviously meant to be struck to start
the chamber's movement. It is not, however, a mechanical device-it is actually powered by a flock of twelve
harpies. They nest along the elevator shaft, and when
the bell is wrung, they fly down and grab hooks in the
top of the chamber. The harpies are strong enough to
move the elevator upwards by one level, and then they
must rest for 1 hour. The elevator descends via gravity,
and its speed is slowed by a system of gears.
The harpies are mostly harmless since they can't get at
anyone in the elevator. However, if they are annoyed by
whoever is using the elevator, they will use their luring
song and laugh as anyone inside the elevator futilely tries
to reach them through the bronze lattice work.

S7. The Iron Saddle




This chamber is entirely covered in iron-walls, ceiling
and floor-almost like a prison cell. A huge iron statue
of a snake-like medusa stands in the center of the
room on a raised dais. On the medusa's back is a
saddle that is large enough to seat several humanoids.
On the opposite wall is an adamantine door with an
iron door knocker.




This entrance hall to the Forge Room is trapped, thanks
to Garzoon's creative insanity and hard work.
The double doors leading into the Forge are made
of adamantine and barred from the other side. If the
knocker is used, a small viewing window will open in the
door and one of the myrmekes will ask for the proper
password ("Noozrag"). Garzoon activates the trap from
the Forge Room (S1) after three failed attempts.
The Magma Trap. The entrance door seals thanks to
an adamantine block some 5 feet thick. Two holes open
in the ceiling and magma pours into the chamber. The
flow covers the floor within one round. Anyone in contact with the magma takes 55 (10d10) fire damage. The
air of the room becomes superheated by the 4th round,
and anyone in the air takes 21 (6d6) fire damage.

The Medusa Statue. The one apparently safe place in
the chamber is the statue. It remains cool, as does the air
within 5 feet of it. Its saddle can hold six Medium-sized
creatures. However, one round after someone sits in the
saddle, the statue will begin to buck.
To stay in the saddle, a creature must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength
(Athletics) check. On a failure, they are flung 10 feet in a
random direction into the magma. The DC of the check
increases by 1 every round. Someone sitting in front or
behind a creature who loses their grasp in this way can
use their reaction to make a DC 15 Athletics check to
grab them and keep them safely on the saddle.
After five rounds, the magma drains into a chamber
below. One round later, the statue stops rocking, and a
myrmekes will open the adamantine door in order to
investigate. Garzoon's trap cannot be reset.

S8. The Central Stair




These stairs are of a scale to suit giants, cyclopes, and
other huge creatures. A few steps up the stairway, a
large bronze horn is suspended from the ceiling, perhaps intended for guards to sound an alarm.


S10. Golem Workshop


S9. The Bronze Molds




This room is a casting workshop of some kind. An
oversized mold of a bull hangs from the ceiling, glowing
red from the liquid metal inside. Six-armed gygans
and winged insect men work side by side, assembling
various parts into massive bronze bulls. Two completed
bulls stand along one wall.


This molding room is where the gorgons for the coming
war effort are constructed. There are two gygans
directing nine advanced myrmekes to put the creatures
together from molded parts. There are two gorgons in
here that are already operational.
The gygans and gorgons attack trespassers on sight.
The myrmekes will stand aside as a group and watch the
battle with cold curiosity. They will only fight to defend



Stone slabs overflow with bronze and iron parts. A
massive iron press looms in the center of the room,
and there is a pipe-fed water trough on the south wall.
Gygans supervise insect men as they piece together
human-looking constructs of some kind.



The central stair is not designed with humans in mind.
Any creature smaller than a cyclops must treat the stairs
as difficult terrain.
On each floor, there is a large horn. It takes an action
to blow a horn. When a horn is blown, the sound carries
all the way to the top of the tower. The tower's inhabitants immediately move to "alert" status when the horn
is sounded. See the table in The Inhabitants of Praxys
section, above, for the various effects this can have on
the tower's denizens.



themselves if attacked. Once the gygans and gorgons are
dead, the myrmekes will try to convince the heroes to
free their queen.
The Portcullis. As a bonus action, one gygan can pull
a lever close to the forge. The lever seals the main door
with an adamantine portcullis. The portcullis requires a
combined Strength of 30 to lift. At your discretion, the
sound of the portcullis may be loud enough to attract
the attention of the blemys in The Water Wheels (S5).
The blemys arrive as reinforcements 2 rounds later.
The Molten Trap. As an action, any Large-sized creature can pull a lever on the gorgon bull mold that hangs
from the ceiling, causing the floor to flood with molten
metal. Anyone standing more than 5 feet from a wall
will be hit by the molten bronze. They must make a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 36 (8d8) fire damage
(half damage on a successful save).
Window Ledges. There are windows in this chamber.
One of the window ledges is the nest of a mated pair
of griffons. The griffons are not hostile, but they are
protective of their nest.





This is the assembly shop for bronze automatons that
will be used in Sydon's armies.
A single gygan supervises eight advanced myrmekes
that are finishing the assembly of a bronze mechanical
warrior on the central iron press. The bronze construct
resembles a human-sized cyclops.
Assembly involves putting all of the needed pieces in
their proper positions on the central iron press. The top
part of the press then lowers into place and the parts are
superheated. When the press opens, water flows over it,
cooling the new mechanical warrior.
The finished versions are bronze automatons. Four
bronze automatons are currently operational and stand
in a perfect parade line against the east wall.
The gygans and the four bronze automatons attack
intruders while the myrmekes continue working at the
press. The gygan will direct some of the bronze automatons to move onto the central press, hoping that the
heroes will follow them. If at least one intruder is on the
press, the gygan will pull a lever to activate it.
The Press. Anyone on the press must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw or be crushed by the press for
55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. Anyone who survives
the damage is stuck in the machinery and must make a
DC 20 Athletics check to escape. Anyone reduced to 0

hit points by the damage is crushed into bloody paste.
Automatons on the press are crushed when it is activated, and they don't recognize it as a threat.
Bronze Pipes. This room can be accessed via the
network of bronze pipes that runs through the tower
(see The Bronze Pipes, S4). The pipes supply water to
the press. Anyone entering the room from the pipes
will stand up in 3 ft. of water in the water trough.
Re-entering the pipes is easy to do from the trough.



S11. Myrmekes Queen






In the center of this sparse chamber is an enormous,
bloated insectoid. The creature is vaguely humanoid
in form, but it is giant-sized and has six legs. Each of
the prisoner's legs are bound with chains, preventing
it from moving. Two headless cyclopean figures stand
watch over the insect creature.


Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don



This is where the gygans garrison lives when off duty.
There are usually 4 gygans asleep in this room at any
time. Smaller, human-sized guests are given space here as
well.
Treasure. Each chest contains the personal equipment for two gygans. Each has 4d20 gp and 8d20 sp.

S13. The Kitchens


The door to this room is locked, and it requires a DC 20
Dexterity check with thieves' tools to open.
This is the prison where Sydon keeps the myrmekes
queen locked away. By keeping her prisoner, Sydon
keeps all of the myrmekes in the tower loyal. Sydon has
always been interested in the possibilities of the myrmekes race, but he is very wary of the damage that they
could do to the world if one of their queens were to be
set loose, backed by resentful followers.
The myrmekes queen imprisoned here is guarded
by two blemys cyclops. They are under orders to kill
the queen if anyone breaks into the chamber. They will
focus their attacks on the queen until she is dead, and
then turn their attacks on trespassers. The blemys are
intelligent enough to turn their attacks on the party if
they feel that their lives are in danger.
The Queen Lives. If the myrmekes queen lives, she
will try to bargain for a way out of Praxys. She summons
all of the myrmekes on the level to her. Then she offers
one of her advanced myrmekes as a companion to each
of the heroes in exchange for a clear path to freedom.
The Queen Dies. If the myrmekes queen is killed,
then the rest of the myrmekes sink into a torpor and will
not react to anything that happens around them, with
two exceptions. Firstly, any hero who took part in killing
the myrmekes queen will be marked by the scent of her
death. Any myrmekes in the same area as a queenslayer
will attempt to kill the offender, even at the cost of its
own life. All other enemies will be ignored. Secondly, the
myrmekes will still defend themselves if attacked.
Letting the myrmekes queen leave the tower is a very
bad idea. Refer to Titan's Folly in The Cerulean Gulf
chapter for details about the consequences. It could spell
the eventual doom of all other intelligent races.



This barracks seems normal except for the size of
everything. The ten bunk beds are exactly like you'd
find in army barracks anywhere-except much bigger.
In front of every pair of beds is a massive chest, and
along one wall are some normal-sized beds, which
appear childlike in contrast to the others.





A spicy, delicious aroma fills this room, which is obviously a kitchen. Pans clatter as four goatlings scurry
along, hard at work, assisting the chef in his day-to-day
tasks. The chef is a satyr who leans over a large iron
stove. The room bustles with activity and warmth.




The chef is Ramsus (NE satyr) who is assisted by 4
goatling tricksters. The kitchen staff are not excited by
the idea of fighting, and Ramsus has no great love for
Sydon. He is willing to help the heroes, but the goatlings
only want to cause mischief.
Goatling Pranksters. The goatlings will hurl insults
at the heroes in an attempt to enrage them. If they are
threatened, they will use mislead to turn invisible and
make their escape. Then they will follow the heroes and
use their polymorph powers to turn the heroes' enemies
into giant crocodiles, wooly mammoths, or whatever
other strange beasts they think are funny.
Ramsus's Plan. If the heroes persuade Ramsus to help
them, he suggests the following plan. He will hide the
heroes in a feast and send it to the top level of the tower.
They will hide in giant-sized loaves of bread, and the
gygans-who arrive within an hour-will use the elevator to take the food directly to the Throne Room (S28).
Dinner is Served. If the throne room is empty, then
the heroes can wait until the gygans leave before breaking the bread and exploring. However, if the throne
room is occupied by Sydon or his children, then the
heroes might wish to stay hidden until the Titans leave.
In this case, there is a 50% chance that one of the Titans
will be hungry enough to break open the bread and
reveal the heroes, much to their annoyed delight.
Bronze Pipes. This room can be accessed via the network of bronze pipes that runs through the tower (see
The Bronze Pipes, S4). Only creatures of Tiny size can

reach the kitchens. The pipes that feed the water into
the kitchen are too small for larger creatures.
The Portcullis. A lever in the kitchen activates an
adamantine portcullis that seals off the room. Lifting the
portcullis requires a combined Strength of 30. Ramsus
will use it to divide intruders in the event of a battle.

S14. The Treasury




A stone corridor stretches ahead of you, and two stone
cyclops heads decorate the walls. The hall is lined with
javelins, and it leads to a heavy adamantine door.




This is where Garzoon (The Forge Room, S1) keeps his
secret treasure stash. The entrance is hidden in the
southern wall of The Water Wheels (S5).
Garzoon has fashioned a deadly trap in the secret hall
that leads to the room. It is activated if anyone touches
the door without saying the password ("Talieus").
The two stone cyclops heads, one on the south side of
the hall and one on the north, are part of the trap. The
eyes in these heads watch whoever walks in. The door
that leads to the treasury is made from adamantine and
is locked. It requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check
using thieves' tools to open.
Javelin Trap. The halls are lined with javelins: 40 in
total. There is a tiny mechanical latch inside the door
that triggers the hallway trap. If the door is opened
slowly, a successful DC 20 Investigation check reveals
the latch. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check is
required to disarm the latch in time to stop the trap.
If the trap is triggered, then the two cyclops
heads shoot a bolt of lightning that fills the hallway.
Everyone in the hall must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw or they take (35) 10d6 lightning damage

(half damage on a save). The lightning also electrifies
all of the javelins.
Next, 1d4 javelins per person per round jump from
the wall and fly towards their targets. The javelins have
+10 to hit and each hit inflicts 1d6 piercing damage and
4d6 lightning damage. There are 40 javelins in total, and
each can attack only once.
Disabling the Trap. There are ways to disable the
trap before it triggers. Placing a blindfold over the
cyclopes' eyes will prevent the trap from triggering. If
the javelins are tied down, removed from the room, or
broken, then they won't be capable of attacking.
Treasure
This is where Garzoon keeps everything that he's most
proud of creating, including masterwork items that he
refused to surrender to Sydon.
The Quiver of Ehlonna hangs from one wall, and
inside are three javelins of lightning. There is also a mannequin of a gygan, and each pair of its hands is wearing
a different set of gloves: gloves of missile snaring, gloves
of swimming and climbing, and gauntlets of ogre strength.
Coins with a total value of 2,500 pp are heaped along the
west wall. There are also three chests. One chest has two
dozen pearls worth 100 gp each. The second chest has a
dozen black pearls each worth 500 gp.
Chest of Beetles. The third chest has twelve miniature
mezzoloths inside. Each of the mezzoloths is 6 inches
tall and looks like a large humanoid beetle. When the
chest is opened, they immediately begin climbing up
the sides of the chest to escape. The heroes should roll
for initiative. At initiative counts 12 through 1, a single
mezzoloth will reach the outside, grow to full size, and
attack. Closing the chest will prevent any mezzoloths
still inside from escaping. If the lid is closed, the chest
rattles violently for a moment and then grows still.
Reopening the chest restarts the process.

The Heavens
The Heavens are where the greatest heroes of Thylea
are summoned by Sydon to dwell forever. Time doesn't
move forward on this level, so anyone living here is
effectively immortal. Great heroes of the centaurs,
minotaurs, gygans, and other ancient races of Thylea
exist on this level. Some are effectively more than a
thousand years old, but for them, no time has passed
since they arrived. The denizens of the Heavens are
mostly oblivious to their detachment from the rest of
Thylea, and they care little about the outside world.
The greatest aspiration of knights in the Order of
Sydon is to be granted the honor of dwelling on this
level of Praxys. The northern wall of this level connects
to a demi-plane of nearly endless beautiful fields, peaceful forestlands, clear streams, and picturesque mountains. Sydon is good to his most loyal servants.

Wandering Monsters
The heroes may randomly encounter one gygan hero
or minotaur hero in the halls of the Heavens. Use these
creatures as reinforcements to challenge the heroes if
they are making progress too easily.

S15. Sparring Chamber




This large, open chamber is filled with the smell of
sweat and coppery blood. A fearsome minotaur and a
massive gygan warrior are fighting each other, honing
their skills for battle.

Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

Seductive Feeling. Heroes who enter the demiplane
are overcome with a feeling of joy, and anyone who
remains here for more than an hour must make a DC
10 Wisdom saving throw or else they refuse to leave.
Characters who wish to stay will actively resist being
removed. The party may be forced to lure them out by
force or with magic. Once removed from the demiplane,
the feeling of joy dissipates after 1 minute.
Birds and Beasts. The plane is populated by wild
animals, including dangerous species such as wolves
and bears. Most of these animals are larger and more
majestic than their counterparts in Thylea or the outer
world.
Despite the beauty and tranquility of these Elysian
fields, they are dangerous for trespassers. When Sydon's
warriors discover trespassers here, they immediately
engage them in battle. Possible encounters include:

M23. Chamber of Love
M24. Chamber of Music
M25. Dragon's Chamber
M26. The Great Arena
M27. The Dragon Stables

This is where great warriors test their mettle against
one other. At almost any time of the day, two minotaur
heroes and two gygan heroes can be found here. One
minotaur and one gygan will be sparring in the central
pit while the other pair watch and pass judgement. The
sparring creatures have half their hit points remaining.
All of them will attack trespassers on sight.

S16. Central Corridor
This central corridor connects all of the chambers
and rooms on this level. It is always patrolled by four
minotaur heroes who intercept trespassers. There are
carefully concealed wall triggers on each corner of the
central corridor. These can be spotted with a passive
Perception score of 15 or higher. When one of the triggers is pushed, it activates all of the scythe blade traps
along the corridor at the places marked X.
Scythe Blade Traps. The minotaurs are clever enough
to lure opponents into standing in these dangerous positions while their comrades activate the trap. At these
points, five-foot-wide, razor-sharp, adamantine blades
will shoot out at intervals of 2 feet. Anyone standing
in the area when the blades deploy must make a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 54 (12d8) slashing
damage (half damage on a successful save). Anyone
reduced to 0 hit points is sliced into 2d4 chunks.

1. A mob of twelve centaur heroes led by one ancient
centaur druid roams the plains.
2. Twelve gygan heroes compete in feats of strength.
Some wrestle, while others lift large weights.
3. A pack of twelve dire wolves hunts at night; the
heroes hear howling before the pack attacks them.
4. A huge mother bear (polar bear with maximum hit
points) and her four cubs (brown bears) wander
through the woods, searching for food.
5. A great boar crashes through the tall grass, pursued
by twelve lions and a majestic golden lion.
6. A white stag runs through the woods, pursued by a
hunting band of five minotaur heroes.

S19. The Baths


Two enormous bathtubs are full of water that spills in
from bronze pipes. Steam rises from one bath, whereas
the other bath appears to be full of cold water. Gygans
are lounging in the tubs, rinsing off sweat from a hard
day's work. You hear feminine voices from one of the
adjacent changing rooms.

S17. The Elevator
This elevator can be used to access the other two levels,
The Forge (S6) and The Throne (S36). It is unguarded on
this level. Refer to The Elevator (S17) for details about
how the elevator is powered and activated.



S18. Fields of Elysium




This room should be impossible. The walls of the tower
open out onto rolling fields under beautiful blue skies.
Verdant countryside stretches for miles, filled with
colorful flowers and lush vegetation. Birds and beasts
roam freely. What strange magic allows such an enormous space to exist within the walls of the tower?






Four male gygan heroes are bathing, while two female
gygan heroes are getting dressed. None of the gygans
have weapons or armor, so their Armor Class is reduced
to 14. Their multiattack, jancan shortsword, and javelin
attacks are replaced by the following:
Naked Gygan Attacks



Multiattack. The gygan makes five attacks: one with its
grapple and four with its slam.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 8 (1d4 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

The entire wall of this room is open to the demiplane of
Elysium, which spreads out for miles in every direction
and is beautiful beyond words.
Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

229

If they are attacked, the gygans will try to retrieve
the weapons and armor that they stashed in the Gygan
Barracks (S20). Two of them will act as rearguards so
that the others have time to arm themselves.
Bronze Pipes. This room can be accessed via the
network of bronze pipes that runs through the tower
(see The Bronze Pipes, S4). To enter the pipes from here,
a successful DC 15 Strength check is required to open
the valve that stops the water from flowing into the bath.
The valve closes automatically unless it is propped open.
If this is done, The Baths and the rest of the tower level
will eventually become flooded, bringing attention to
this room. Opening the valves from within the room
only requires someone to rotate a large bronze wheel
beside each pipe. Anyone moving through the pipe that
feeds the hot bath takes 10 (3d6) fire damage from the
magical heat that suffuses the last 5 ft. of the pipe.
Window Ledge. The windows here provide a beautiful view of the oceans. Five griffons are perched on the
window ledges at any given time. They will only attack
if they are disturbed. They are accustomed to the loud
noises made by the gygans during bathtime.

S20. Gygan Barracks






The gygan barracks are richly-appointed. There are six
bunk beds in the room for the gygans and six bunk beds
for human-sized guests. There are usually three gygan
heroes sleeping in this room.
The windows provide a view into the Fields of Elysium
(S18). It is possible to climb through them, but this
is a one-way trip, because the windows don't exist on
the other side. Heroes who climb through them arrive
several miles from the usual entrance to the demiplane
(area S18). Navigating back into the tower from here
requires two successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival)
checks, and each attempt takes 1 hour.
If the windows are viewed from the other side (from
the Fields of Elysium), the interior of the gygan barracks
can be seen. However, it isn't actually a window, it is a
magical effect that makes the wall appear transparent.

S21. Minotaur Barracks




This room has large, sturdy bunk beds. The room is
otherwise empty, but it smells like a barnyard. A single
window looks out across lush fields and blue skies.


230

Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

Minotaurs of Praxys
The minotaurs of Praxys are from a lineage that repented
the original sins of their tribe, swearing oaths of fealty to
the Lord of Storms. Their bloodlines have served him for
centuries, in spite of his treatment of other minotaurs.

S22. Waste Room




This room can only be described as a giant privy. There
are toilets designed for creatures of all sizes, from
giants to humans. The room is kept clean by an enormous "headless" giant who is angrily scrubbing at every
surface. When it looks up, you see that it has a mouth
and eyes in the middle of its hairy chest.


Six oversized bunk beds fill this room. There are several
smaller, human-sized beds as well, perhaps for visitors
to the tower. All of the beds are richly-decorated with
soft cotton and fine silks. Windows along the north
wall look out into lush green fields and blue skies.


There are four bunk beds in the room, and usually there
are 2 minotaur heroes sleeping in here. As with the
Gygan Barracks (S20), the window looks out onto the
demiplane of Elysium, and the same conditions apply to
anyone who climbs through it.





This room smells unpleasant at best, even with the
apparently tireless efforts of its caretaker. The blemys
has been given the task of keeping the place clean. It is
a constant struggle, and he is very angry with everyone
and everything. He will happily take out that anger on
any intruder who disturbs him.
Flushing Toilets. The pipes from the toilets lead
straight down to the waste pipe that empties into the
ocean at the bottom of the tower. This is a possible
escape route, but any character who attempts to use it
must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or else
they are too physically repulsed to enter, and they must
have some kind of waterbreathing spell or item.

S23. Chamber of Love




The lulling sounds of a beautiful song fill this chamber.
Through a haze of pleasant-smelling smoke, you can
see a canopied bed, a plush rug, and long, flowing curtains. The singing comes from a beautiful fey woman,
who is perched on the bed, singing to a handsome
giant who appears to be in a deep, restful sleep.


This chamber is furnished for a giant-sized king. An
aurae nymph is singing softly while sitting on the
edge of the bed. Talieus (NE young empyrean), one
of Sydon's children, is asleep in the bed, having been
relaxed by her beautiful voice. The nymph does not
want to fight the heroes or awaken her companion. She
is in love with Talieus and does not want to see him



harmed. With a successful DC 16 Persuasion check, the
nymph can be convinced to keep him fast asleep for the
next 24 hours.
Awakening Talieus. If the heroes do wake Talieus, he
will fight his way out of the room to sound the alarm at
the stairwell. He then races to the Throne Room (S28).
He will also bellow for help, attracting the attention of
any nearby creatures on this level. The nymph will recklessly attack the first hero who harms Talieus.
Treasure. Talieus carries a silver key around his neck
that can be used to unlock Nephele's adamantine shackles in the Dragon's Chamber (S25).

S24. Chamber of Music




This room is occupied by a trio of satyr minstrels who
play a soulful melody on beautiful instruments. The
room is very comfortable, and an audience of two
gygans are relaxing in the room, listening intently to
the music. Four marble statues of handsome naked
men stand in the corners of the room.




Outraged at the interruption of their pleasures, the two
gygan heroes will immediately attack trespassers.
Clever Musicians. When the gygans attack, the
three satyr minstrels continue to play music as if
oblivious to the battle around them. In fact, they are
using their music to disguise the magical assistance
that they are providing to the gygans. If someone is
suspicious of the minstrels, a passive Perception of
15 reveals that they are using spells. Otherwise, they
appear to be lost in their music and unaware of their
surroundings.
Marble Statues. The statues look like they might be
marble golems, but in fact, they are ordinary statues.
Treasure. The satyrs' instruments are carved from the
bones of copper and bronze dragons (Nephele's mates).
The harp is worth 5,000 gp, the drums are worth 1,000
gp, and the horn is worth 7,500 gp.

S25. The Dragon's Chamber


This large, cold room is a prison for a beautiful silver
dragon. She is guarded by two gygans, who shift their
weight nervously under the dragon's hateful gaze. The
dragon appears to be healthy, but she is collared and
shackled to the floor by multiple loops of chain.

Nephele (NE adult silver dragon) is being kept prisoner here. Her chains are adamantine, but they can
be unlocked with the silver key held by Talieus in the
Chamber of Love (S23). She is guarded and fed by two
gygan heroes, who attack trespassers on sight.

The Will of the Gods
If Kyrah or Pythor are with the party, they immediately
recognize the dragon as a clone of their mother. They both
wish to see the dragon freed. They explain that Nephele is
an evil shadow of the ancient dragon Balmytria, but even
so, they cannot bear to see her shackled.

Nephele's Shackles. The collar around the dragon's
neck is magical and nullifies Nephele's ability to change
shape. The chains are adamantine and enchanted with
powerful magic. They have a damage threshold of 10,
AC 23, and 50 HP. They can also be unlocked with the
silver key that Talieus carries around his neck (S23).
Epic Path: The Gifted One





Nephele is a clone from the flesh of the silver dragon
Balmytria, but she has been corrupted by the Titans.
Balmytria's soul never entered her flesh, and she never
learned to speak. When she came of age, Sydon gave her
a pair of bronze and copper dragons to mate with, and
she produced a brood of evil metallic dragons for the
Titan's kennel. Her children include Icarus and Argyn,
who were gifts from Sydon to Gaius and Acastus.
For most of her life, Nephele was free to roam the
tower. But ten years ago, she grew bold and attempted
to escape into the Forgotten Sea. Sydon prevented her,
and she killed dozens of gygans in retaliation. As punishment, Sydon slaughtered her two mates and bound
her here in chains. She nurses a powerful hatred for the
Titan and craves vengeance above all else.

If the Gifted One is present, their grandmother speaks to
them through the locket, revealing that she can help the
dragon. The spirit of the sorceress can enter the dragon,
providing the clone with a soul. The dragon will gain the
ability to speak, but her personality will be torn between
arrogance and madness. Her goal is revenge upon Sydon.
Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.



When set free, Nephele will immediately polymorph
into the form of one of the heroes, except with silver
hair. She will follow the heroes, but she will not get
involved in any fighting. She behaves like a stray cat, and
she bonds to the first hero who offers her food.
Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

231

The Dragon Clone
As an adult silver dragon who has used her change shape
ability to assume a form, Nephele still retains her hit
points, legendary resistance, Intelligence, Wisdom and
Charisma. While she won't be useful as a combatant, she
can survive significant amounts of damage. If she is present during a battle against Sydon, then she returns to her
silver dragon form and attacks the Titan relentlessly.

Talieus, Son
of Sydon

Treasure
There are three dragon eggs in this room. Two of the
dragon eggs are cold and dead, because they have been
completely neglected. However, one of the dragon eggs
is healthy, and if it is properly cared for, it will hatch a
silver dragon wyrmling in 1d6 days.

S26. The Great Arena




This huge chamber is some sort of arena, filled with
terrifying obstacles. To the left of you are huge double
doors made from iron. To the right of you, the arena is
obscured by a magical darkness. In the center is a pole
where prisoners would likely be chained.
From three large pits comes the sound of grinding
metal. Huge iron spheres roll along paths set in the
middle of the floor. When they reach the end of the
path, the spheres vanish and reappear at the start.
There are few places in the room that look safe.
Anywhere you stand, you're likely to be in mortal peril.




This large arena is used by Sydon and his children as
entertainment. Prisoners are dumped in the arena to
fight dragons for the amusement of Sydon, his children,
and his many gygan, centaur, and minotaur servants.
The prisoners also make excellent snacks for Sydon's
kennel of dragons (S27). The room has several features
that look deadly but are easily avoidable.
The Pit Traps. The three pits are each 10 feet wide
and 30 feet deep. Scything blades constantly spin at the
bottom of the pits. Creatures that fall in take 10 (3d6)
bludgeoning damage and 20 (6d6) slashing damage on
the first round. Creatures in the pit take 20 (6d6) slashing damage every round until they escape.
The Iron Balls. There are two five-foot-wide curved
paths that run from east to west, and iron balls roll along
each path. One of the balls rolls east and the other rolls
west. When the balls reach the end of their paths, they
teleport back to their starting points. Moving across the
path usually requires a DC 5 Dexterity check, but the
DC is increased to 15 for creatures with a movement
speed of 10 or less (or creatures affected by something
like a slow spell). Failure results in 36 (8d8) bludgeoning
damage from one of the rolling balls.
232

Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

Sydon and Lutheria bore children together several
centuries ago, intending to create a new pantheon
of young empyreans. The Twins disagreed on few
things more than how the children should be raised.
In the end, the Lord of Storms had his way.
- Chondrus, Priest of Lutheria

Audience Chamber. An audience chamber on the
west side of the arena allows a safe view of the action.
The audience is protected by a permanent wall of force.
Most of the seats are for Large-sized creatures, but the
central throne is obviously made for a Huge-sized creature. The windows looking out on to the ocean in this
room are also permanent walls of force.
The Arena Battle
If the tower is on alert, then this room has been prepared as a trap for the heroes. Otherwise, it is empty.
Captured Prisoners. The arena has several naked
prisoners chained to the stake in the middle of the room.
These prisoners could be Ultros crewmembers or other
characters who are important to the heroes, including
people who should be back on the mainland. If none of
those characters are appropriate, then the prisoners are

naiad nymphs who have displeased Sydon. The stakes
and manacles are made of adamantine.
Springing the Trap. The door that leads to the audience chamber is locked and barred with arcane lock.
The audience chamber is covered in a darkness spell and
a curtain as well (which blocks the view for those who
can see through magical darkness). Inside the audience
chamber is Sydon's son, Talieus, (CE young empyrean),
and a half-dozen goatlings tricksters.
Talieus waits until some of the heroes have entered
the arena, and then he drops an adamantine portcullis
and a wall of force at each of the doors in the hallway
outside the room entrance. The portcullis over the
entrance is a ruse-it's only there for decoration. The
darkness spell vanishes, the curtain falls, and the audience is revealed, laughing and joking about the doom
that awaits everyone trapped inside the arena.




Suddenly, the darkened portion of the arena lights
up. It's a seated audience of laughing goatlings and a
handsome titan reclining upon a huge throne. The titan
bellows, "Let the match begin!"
Before you can get your bearings, the doors on the
far side of the arena open and three dragons claw their
way out, roaring, to cheers of appreciation from the
audience. You face three hungry dragons-one bronze,
one silver, and one copper.


that he will make the heroes suffer for killing his pets.
He continues to make threats as he puts on the ornate
armor hanging on the wall. This takes 1d6 rounds,
giving the heroes some time to recover from the dragon
fight. When Talieus is ready, he pulls the lever that
returns the room to its original state and turns off the
wall of force that separates the arena from the viewing
room. He fights to the death.
Epic Paths: Confronting Talieus
If the Dragonslayer is present, then Talieus is aware of
their reputation and concentrates his mockery on them.
The dragons focus their attacks on the Dragonslayer.
Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

S27. The Dragon Stables




These stables are warm and pleasant. Hay and wood
chips crunch below your feet. The size of the room and
all of the food, equipment, and facilities suggest that
these stables are not for normal beasts.




The young bronze, silver and copper dragons try
to kill everyone in the arena. The bronze dragon uses
its repulsion breath to force victims into the pits. The
copper dragon uses its slowing breath on creatures to
make the iron balls more dangerous. Any creature paralyzed by the silver dragon's breath attack can be pushed
into a pit-or into the path of one of the rolling balls.
Talieus and the chorus of goatlings laugh mercilessly
during the fight, mocking the heroes whenever anything
bad happens to them.
Surviving the Arena. If the heroes manage to defeat
the dragons, Talieus flies into a rage and kills several of
the goatlings in the viewing chamber. He then proclaims



A young bronze dragon, young silver dragon, and
young copper dragon are kept here. They are hostile to
everyone except their gygan keepers and the empyreans.
The stables are empty if the heroes have already battled
the dragons in The Great Arena (S26).
The two double doors that connect to The Dragon's
Chamber (S25) are made from adamantine and are both
locked. They can be opened with a successful DC 25
Dexterity check using thieves' tools.
Smash Trap. A pressure plate between the two double
doors triggers a trap (DC 20 passive Perception to notice
the plates). The trap is a massive 10 ft. cube stone block
that drops between the doors and blocks access. Anyone
under the stone block must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or they take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage
(half damage on save). Anyone reduced to 0 hit points
by this damage is reduced to a bloody paste. Otherwise
they are shoved into one of the adjoining rooms.

The Throne
The Throne level of Praxys is the dwelling place of
Sydon, Lord of Storms. From this level he watches over
faraway places and even other planes of existence using
magical scrying pools, telescopes, and other instruments. The children of Sydon and Lutheria spend most
of their time on this level, learning from Sydon and
preparing to take on the mantles of godhood from the
Five. The children are named after the brothers and
sisters that Sydon and Lutheria betrayed millennia ago:

Talieus, Hergeron, Chalcia, Goloron and Yala. All of
their children are young empyreans.
The whole level is also a museum and gallery. Sydon
keeps trophies from his triumphs here-a measure
of his vainglorious love for himself-and artifacts of
great power. This self-aggrandizement continues with
the many statues of Sydon, showing him in all kinds of
flattering ways: as a warrior, a judge, a philosopher, a
father, a king, a giver of wisdom, a singer of songs, and
Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don

a mighty hunter. Beautiful murals depict the history of
Sydon and Lutheria in the most flattering light possible.
Sydon is a boastful creature who has no qualms celebrating his own greatness.



This lavish, massive chamber is a throne room built for
Titans. It is dominated by six majestic thrones arranged
in a semicircle. The center of the room is dominated
by a perfect representation of the continent of Thylea,
which is painted on the floor. The painting is stunningly
real-clouds drift and ocean waves ripple.




Sydon's favored daughter Chalcia (NE young empyrean) is usually here, attending to matters in her father's
absence. Sydon has spoiled her quite badly. She is easily
bored and has no interest in the heroes, even if the
tower is on high alert. She is attended by a harem of
twelve beautiful men (NE nobles) who desperately try
to entertain her. If the heroes explore this room before

Chalcia, Daughter
of Sydon

Sydon returns, then she may engage them in conversation out of idle curiosity, but she won't attack them
unprovoked unless ordered to do so by her father.
The World Map. The map on the floor is more than
just a perfect representation of the continent of Thylea.
Sydon can use it to teleport to any location on the continent, and anyone with a teleport spell can use the map in
the same manner. If you wish, this can be Sydon's escape
route if he is losing a battle against the heroes, especially
if you want him to appear in the Battle of Mytros.
The Windows. The windows in this room are permanent walls of force which cannot be dispelled.

S29. Main Hall
This hall runs along the eastern, western, and northern
sides of the level. On the east and the west are a pair of
nooks, holding iron statues of Sydon. These two iron
golems are usually inactive, but they animate when
commanded by Sydon or one of his children. They also
activate if the alert is sounded in the tower, or when
someone exits the Elevator (S36) without using the
proper pass phrase.

S30. The Vault Entrance




This large chamber is suffused with an overwhelming
stench. A massive three-headed hound stands in the
middle of the room. His filth and excrement are everywhere. Behind the hound stands a set of heavy double
doors made from adamantine. The hound growls at
you, daring you to take even one step further.


The two sets of adamantine double doors that lead
into this room are locked. Picking the lock requires a
successful DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves' tools.
Without tools or the knock spell, it is almost impossible
to open these indestructible doors.
This chamber is guarded by a fully-grown cerberus;
treat this area as its lair. The creature attacks anyone
who steps into the chamber-but not before taunting
them with promises of the treasures hidden within the
vault, which it takes great pride in protecting.



The heavy doors open into a treasure gallery. There
are six pillars in the room, and each pillar supports a
shimmering glass case. The items within the cases are:
a black helmet, a huge dragon skull, an enormous ruby,
an ancient scroll, a huge bronze gauntlet, and a sword
and shield.

centuries ago and fitted for a giant-sized creature.
However, it automatically shrinks or expands to fit
anyone who attunes to it.
• Balmytria's Skull. This massive, impressive dragon
skull is missing one of its horns. It has no inherent
value, but the gods grant a wish spell to anyone who
treats the skull with proper reverence by immolating it
in a funeral pyre or by returning it to its rightful tomb.
• Ruby Gate. This is a huge, magically-imbued ruby
that works in the same fashion as a cubic gate.
• Scroll of the Pact. This scroll documents the original
pact forged between Mytros, Sydon, and Lutheria.
Libraries and scholars across Thylea would give anything in exchange for a chance to study the scroll.
• Gauntlet of Power. Sydon tried to use this item and
broke it in frustration when it didn't work for him.
The four gems embedded in it are a sapphire, a ruby, a
diamond, and an emerald, and each is worth 5,000 gp.
• Holy Sword and Shield. This beautifully-forged pair
of items includes a holy avenger short sword and a
spell guard shield made for a human-sized warrior.

S32. Hall of Fallen Heroes


This long hall is filled with dozens of statues. Most
are depictions of human, elven, and dwarven warriors.
Others depict cyclopes, centaurs, and minotaurs. All of
them are fantastically lifelike in appearance, even down
to the horrified expressions on their faces.


Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don



This room is the sanctuary of the Furies, but their
presence is not immediately obvious. They stand utterly
still, gazing out of the western window. Heroes with a
passive Perception score of 16 or higher notice them
first. Eventually, they reveal themselves.

• Shadowy Helm. This helmet of darkness was forged





This chamber is dominated by two massive contraptions. The first is a mithral orrery, a model of the solar
system that shows the relative positions and motions
of the planets around the Sun. The second item is a
gilded bronze telescope, some 20 feet long and apparently designed for use by a giant.



The two sets of adamantine double doors that lead into
the vault are also locked. Picking the lock requires a
successful DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves' tools.
Otherwise, the knock spell must be used on each door.
Sydon's greatest treasures are on display here,
although the only creature normally allowed inside is
the Titan himself. Each artifact rests inside a glass case
on top of a marble pillar. There are no traps, tricks, or
secrets here, because Sydon does not believe anyone
could possibly reach them. Reaching the objects is as
simple as opening each case, but you do not need to tell
your players that-let them worry a little.

236

The statues are the petrified remains of those who have
displeased Sydon, all carefully lined up in ranks. They are,
in effect, another of Sydon's trophy galleries. A euryale
medusa guards the statues. She remains hidden and
ambushes trespassers in her lair, unless she is summoned
to the Throne Room (S28) by Chalcia.



The Furies
Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone (LN erinyes) are called
"the Furies," and they are the queens of the erinyes. They
gather in this chamber to discuss how vengeance should
be exacted in accordance with the customs and laws of
Thylea. As long as the heroes have not broken an oath
or violate the rules of guest-friendship, the Furies treat

Megaera,
the Fury

them with a politeness verging on indifference. They are
not particularly interested in the heroes, but they do not
wish them any harm.
Oathbreakers. If any of the heroes is an oathbreaker,
the Furies will be enraged by their presence. Any character who has suffered the curse of the treacherous is
an affront to them, and becomes an instant target. The
Furies will attack relentlessly, ignoring everyone else
until the offender is unconscious. Unlike their daughters, the Furies do not attempt to capture oathbreakers.
They simply nail them to the tower walls and let harpies
and griffons tear them apart.
Wisdom of the Furies. The Furies have no love for
Sydon, and they have no loyalty to him. They are willing
to advise anyone who asks for help in defeating the
Titan. All they ask in return is fair payment, such as a
magical item. The item must be rare or better. If suitably
paid, the Furies will reveal several useful bits of information to the heroes:

• "Jamming the gears that move the planets will grant
those nearby valuable time."

• "The ancient red star is only minutes from death, but

time doesn't pass in the astral sea. The star can be
lured to the mortal world to destroy the tower with
the light of its younger love."
• "Sydon has made a mockery of both dragons and gods.
Nephele should be allowed to have her vengeance."
The Telescope
The huge magical telescope allows anyone using it to see
any faraway place, even other worlds and other planes of
existence. All the viewer needs to do is think of a place
that they have already visited (or a person that they
know). The telescope will act as a scrying spell, immediately showing them that person or place.
Unlike a scrying spell, the telescope can see beyond
the Prime Material Plane, into other planes of existence.
It is used by the Furies to spy upon all of mortal kind;
the Furies have been everywhere in the multiverse, and
there are no limits to what they can see.
The Orrery
This artifact was made by Sydon and the sphinxes from
the Island of Time. It is a perfect representation of all
the worlds in the solar system with the sun at the very
center. The mechanism has a clever arrangement of
gears and pivots that moves the planets around the sun,
moves the moons around the planets, and spins all of
the planetary bodies on their axes.
The orrery shows exactly where all of the planets and
moons are in the solar system at the present moment
in time. Sydon intended to use the machine to travel
through time, but it never worked as intended. As far as
he is concerned, it's just a magnificent toy.
Stopping Time. Jamming the gears of the orrery
produces an effect similar to a time stop spell. The time
stop allows anyone within 10 ft. of the orrery to act as

normal, as if they were the caster of the time stop spell.
Once the time stop ends, the orrery breaks down and
can only be repaired with the aid of a sphinx. To jam
the orrery, a magical weapon must be used. Anything
non-magical just breaks when thrusted into the gears.
The Windows. The windows in this room are permanent walls of force which cannot be dispelled.

S34. Hall of Travel




This room is filled with soft light and calming silence.
Light spills from a pool in the floor that is filled with a
strange, silvery liquid. The liquid is perfectly still and
glitters with the reflections of countless stars. It's like
looking through a window into a cosmic vista.




The pool is a gateway that allows anyone who steps into
it to travel to the Astral Plane. Any creature who walks
into the pool will be swallowed by the liquid. Once
submerged, they will find themselves in a vast ocean of
silver lights, with the pool's surface overhead. The lights
are millions of stars. One can easily return to the tower
by "swimming" up to the pool's surface.
The Dying Star
Floating nearby is a radiant crimson sphere, an ancient
star, a few hours-or perhaps minutes-from death. It
radiates a faint heat, like a warm breeze against the skin.
Sydon keeps this star on the Astral Plane, where time
does not pass. He suspects that allowing the star to die
will unleash a burst of primordial magic, and he seeks
to keep the star in stasis until he understands how to
harness such immense power. The star is intelligent, but
it is an utterly alien and incomprehensible lifeform.
Luring the Star. The star can be lured out of the
Astral Plane. A torch lit from the fires of the Fallen Star
(S37) will attract the star. It follows anyone who carries
such a torch out of the Astral Plane and into the tower.
Despite apparent problems with its size, the red star
passes through the pool without issue. If the party needs
a clue for this puzzle, you may choose to have one hero
experience a vision of a torch being held aloft from the
highest point of Praxys.
The Star's Death. Once on the material plane, the
star lives for 1d10 minutes before dying. As it does so,
it shrinks, grows dimmer, and explodes into blinding
light. Anyone within 10 feet of the star when it explodes
receives the benefit of the foresight spell for 8 hours,
thanks to the star's primordial magic.
If the heroes are rash enough to travel further into the
Astral Plane, they must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Surival)
check every other round or lose track of where the pool
is located. The Astral Plane is beyond the scope of this
book, but any character lost on the plane does not age
and could be rescued much later in the campaign.

Sydon, Lord of Storms
Sydon's Journal
Sydon keeps records of his proudest achievements in a
huge, leatherbound journal that rests on a lectern in his
chamber. Some notable entries include:
Talieus. "My son Talieus is a fool and a braggart. He's
much too proud of his own accomplishments, and they
are few indeed. He is unfit for the throne."
Hergeron. "My son Hergeron is unlike his namesake. He
is cunning and clever and good with numbers. I shall need
his sharp mind to manage my armies."
Goloron. "My son Goloron bears a strong resemblance
to his mother. He seems to have inherited her madness. I
shall have to keep a close watch on him."
Versi. "My daughter Versi infuriates me! She is always
disobedient, and she loves her mortal pets too much. But
I am pleased that she bears the gift of prophecy."
Yala. "My daughter Yala is the strongest warrior among
my children. She fights at the head of my armies. Mortals
shall flee in terror before her wrathful temper."
Chalcia. "My daughter Chalcia is blessed with all of my
greatest qualities. She is headstrong and stubborn, but I
believe that she will make a worthy successor."

S37. The Fallen Star


S35. Chamber of Sydon





This is a massive, luxurious bedroom that has clearly
been designed for a Titan. Every surface is painted with
murals or decorated with mosaics that glorify the Lord
of Storms. The room does not appear to see much use.




Other than a few trinkets worth 1,000 gp in total, there
is little of interest here. Sydon delights in the attention
and worship of his servants. He sees little reason to
spend time on his own.

S36. Elevator
The elevator doors on this floor are locked and cannot be
opened except by magic. A single knock spell will weaken
the age-old magic that seals the doors. Three knock spells
in a row will allow the doors to be opened.
Pass Phrase. The doors will open if Sydon or one of
his children wishes to use the elevator-or if the correct
pass phrase is spoken. The phrase must be spoken in the
giant tongue. The phrase is:
"THERE IS ONE TRUE GOD,
and his name is SYDON."
238

Ch apter 8 - Pr a x ys, Tower of Sy don



A massive, radiant sphere floats at the very top of the
tower, although nothing appears to hold it in place. It
shines too brightly to look at directly, and it pulses very
slowly, almost as if it were breathing.

At the very top of his tower, Sydon has imprisoned his
most valued treasure-a star that fell from the heavens
ages ago. The star is the source of the roving light at the
peak of the tower. It radiates an intense heat, and anything coming within 10 feet of it will catch fire.
Creatures that come too close take 6d6 fire damage
per round as long as they remain near. It is possible
to ignite a torch using this heat, but the person who
does so will take 1d6 damage in the process. The star's
"flames" are silver and radiate magic.
The star is, like its companion on the Astral Plane,
utterly alien and incomprehensible. It was bound to the
tower by ancient magic. Sydon has forgottten how this
was accomplished, but he knows that a wish spell will
free it from its long imprisonment.
Freeing the Star. Freeing the star causes the tower
to shake and collapse. The process is irrevocable once
started, and the amount of time it takes is up to you as
the GM. The heroes should feel that they are in imminent danger as they try to escape, and they should
make regular saving throws as they dash or fly to safety.
However, the star will protect the party as the tower
collapses: gratitude is a universal concept. In this case,
the heroes may have to battle Sydon or Chalcia in the
collapsed ruins of his Throne Room (S28).



Confronting Sydon
Sydon is not currently in his tower. Instead, he is checking on the progress of the fleet that he has assembled to
send against the city of Mytros. He only returns when
he senses that there are intruders on this floor. Sydon
senses intruders in the following events:

Despite Sydon's demands, he is willing to negotiate. But
in order to satisfy Sydon completely, the heroes must
swear an indefinite oath of service to him.
Rewards from the Vault. Sydon will sweeten his offer
with magical items from The Vault (S31). However, he
cannot resist some mischief-making, so he will only
offer enough magical items for half the heroes at best.
It would greatly amuse him to see the heroes fight
amongst themselves for the rewards.
Kings and Queens. Sydon will offer to make the
heroes kings and queens of Thylea. They can take
whichever cities they please, and the armies of the
Titans will ensure the sanctity of their thrones. However,
the heroes must agree to build and maintain temples to
his new pantheon at their own expense.

• The heroes kill the cerberus (S30)
• The heroes open the final door to The Vault (S31)
• The heroes release the dying star (S34)
It takes Sydon 1d6 minutes to return to the tower,
and he does so by emerging from the magical map on
the floor of the Throne Room (S28). Once he returns, he
orders his daughter, Chalcia (LE young empyrean) to
accompany him as he hunts down the intruders. When
he finds the heroes, read out the following:




Sydon turns to face you, and his voice booms out.
"You have impressed me. It requires strength,
wisdom, and courage to carve a path into my domain.
Your valor will not go unheeded.
"However, you must now make a choice. You may
join me and forge a new Oath of Peace... or you may
refuse my offer-in which case, I will destroy you."


• The Fallen Star. Helping the fallen star escape from


The heroes have two options: forge a new oath, or fight.
Epic Path: The Gifted One
If the Gifted One is present, Sydon will recognize them as
his grandchild and size them up with some interest, but
he is disappointed that his progeny could be so small and
weak. Refer to the Running the Epic Paths section for details.

Swearing Fealty to Sydon
If the heroes listen to Sydon's proposal, read the following:




Sydon takes a deep breath and makes his offer.
"If my daughter's prophecy holds true, then the
Mother Goddess has chosen your small band of warriors to forge a new Oath of Peace. But I am not willing
to negotiate. You must either accept my terms or meet
me on the field of battle.
"This is what I propose: You will swear oaths of
service to me and proclaim me King of the Gods. The
Five imposter gods must return the power that they
stole from us. My children will take their place and be
revered as the new pantheon.
"In exchange for your oaths, I shall spare the city of
Mytros. You should know that I am generous to those
who prove loyal to me. You will be the new Lords of
Thylea-great kings of the mortal races."
He smirks. "Now, take a moment to think carefully
on your next words and deeds."


Fighting Sydon
Fighting Sydon will be difficult. One of his few weaknesses is his supreme confidence that he can defeat
them alone. The party may have gained several advantages in their fight against Sydon:
the Hall of Travel (S34). If the heroes freed the star,
then they should have the benefit of the foresight spell.
• The Balmytria Clone. Freeing Nephele, the Balmytria
clone, from the Dragon's Chamber (S25) and bringing
her to the fight. The silver dragon will immediately
attack Sydon and fight to the death.
• The Furies. The heroes might be able to forge a pact
with the Furies in The Room of Far Sight (S33). Having
done that, they could lure Sydon into that chamber
and use the Orrery to gain an advantage. Sydon does
not know that the Orrery has the power of time stop,
and he will pursue heroes if they retreat here.
Sydon's Retreat. Sydon has no desire to fight to the
death at this point. His fleet is already gathering for
an attack on Mytros, and there is no reason for him to
remain here bickering with mortals.
If you want the Lord of Storms to participate in the
Battle of Mytros, then he should escape through the
magical map when he is at 100 hit points or less. In this
case, Sydon orders his daughter to prove that she is
worthy to be queen. Chalcia fights to the death.
Death of the Storm Titan
If the heroes manage to kill Sydon, read the following:




With utter amazement, Sydon realizes he is dying.
He cannot comprehend defeat. Rage overwhelms his
features as life leaves his body. At the very last second,
he screams, and his body is consumed by lightning as
a massive storm rages overhead. When the lightning
stops, the Titan's body is gone, leaving behind the
scent of fresh rain, which blows away on the wind.

Chapter 9:

The Battle of Mytros
"This was the inevitable outcome of the
Oath of Peace. Five centuries of scheming, followed
by one battle to end all battles. Our mother gave
this land a second chance for peace, but neither
gods nor mortals seem to truly desire it."

W

-Vallus, Goddess of Wisdom

hen the heroes left Mytros on
their sea voyage, they had sixty days to
confront the Titans and complete their
quest. When this time expires, the peace
that has reigned for five hundred years will come to an
end, and the Titans will be free to make war upon all the
mortals of Thylea. Sydon has spent centuries preparing
his army for this occasion, and Lutheria gleefully anticipates harvesting the souls of the countless mortals who
will die in the ensuing battle.

On the 50th day of the voyage, Kyrah warns the party
that they have only ten days remaining until the Oath of
Peace comes to an end. She grows distant and agitated-
concerned for the future. She strongly suggests that
the party make haste to confront Sydon and Lutheria,
or else make plans to return to Mytros. The city needs
strong defenses against the coming storm, and she has
no faith in King Acastus.

The End of the Oath
When the Oath of Peace ends, a wave of change spreads
across the lands of Thylea.


The Final Days
Kyrah frequently reminds the party of the time they have
remaining before the Oath of Peace ends. She serves as a
grim harbinger of doom, counting down the number of
days until the Titans unleash hell.

Ch apter 9 - The Battle of My tros



As the sun dawns on the sixtieth day of your voyage,
you realize that something has changed. A strange wind
blows from the southeast, driving black storm clouds
across the heavens, and the sky itself darkens to a
menacing red. You feel deep within your bones that the
Oath of Peace has come to an end. Now, it seems, the
lands and seas and sky of Thylea are filled with anger.
Kyrah and Pythor call you to the deck of the Ultros.
They stand at the prow, gazing off towards the horizon, and their eyes shine like burnished gold.
"The Oath has ended, and we are no longer gods."


The Dragons Revealed


The End of the Oath


The two gods begin to change, slowly at first. Their
skin changes, transforming into metallic scales, and
great wings unfurl from their backs. Their faces transform into something draconic, as sharp teeth protrude
from their mouths. They grow in size, becoming huge.
The deck of the ship can no longer quite accommodate
the bulk of their massive forms.
Kyrah looms up as Pythor takes flight. Both are now
bronze dragons, terrifying, magnificent and dangerous
creatures. Somehow, you understand that they have
always been dragons, but they were held in the guise of
immortals for 500 years by the power of the Oath.


One of the conditions of the Oath of Peace was that the
Five Gods would eventually surrender their power. Now,
that time has come, and they are no longer gods.
Kyrah, Pythor, Volkan, and Vallus are still capable
of polymorphing into their mortal guises, but they no
longer possess the divine powers that were stolen from
the Titans. Mytros herself has gone completely silent,
although priestly magic continues to work.
The Forgotten Dragons



Kyrah explains that long ago, she and her family were
the dragon mounts of the Dragonlords. During the First
War, her mother, Balmytria, tricked the Titans into
surrendering much of their divine power. Consequently,
Balmytria and her brood were transformed into the Five
Gods. The full story is revealed in the Game of the Gods
section of the Secrets and Myths appendix.
Balmytria became known as Mytros, and she
ascended to the outer planes as a true goddess. Kyrah,
Pythor, Volkan, and Vallus remained behind to finish the
First War. The armies of the Titans were destroyed, and
the Dragonlords were killed. In the end, the new gods
and the ancient Titans swore to the Oath of Peace.

From now on, Kyrah, Pythor, Volkan, and Vallus use the
statistics of young bronze dragons, rather than their
previous "immortal" statistics. Their personalities are the
same, but they are no longer gods. Despite the fact that
they use the statistics of young dragons, they are the size
of adults, and they retain the ability to polymorph into
their mortal guises.

The New Dragonlords
The heroes are now given an opportunity to bond with
the four dragons. Each hero has an opportunity to
choose which dragon they would prefer to bond with
and, if the dragon agrees, the hero should follow the
convention and tradition of Thylea by swearing the Oath
of the Dragonlord which can be found in the Dragonlords
appendix. This requires each hero to sacrifice a magic
item and speak the words of the oath aloud.

Return to Mytros
Once the heroes have bonded with the four metallic
dragons, they may take flight and return to Mytros.
When the party arrives, they discover a cataclysm:
Mytros is consumed by chaos, and King Acastus has
only worsened the many dangers that threaten the city.

epic conflicts should occur. The conflicts should be run
in sequential order as presented below.

The city of Mytros looms on the horizon, shadowed
beneath storm clouds. Rays of golden sunlight stream

There is no pause between each of these epic conflicts. Events are now spinning out of anyone's control.
The heroes will not have a chance to short rest between
encounters. At most, they have a few minutes to use

healing potions and spells before the next major threat
begins to unfold. This sequence of events should completely exhaust the heroes, and it should require them to
expend just about every resource that they've accumulated so far in the adventure.
Fighting Alongside Dragons
The players should be given control of their bonded dragons. To keep battles moving quickly, have each dragon
act on the same initiative as the hero riding it. Sydon,
Lutheria, and Kentimane should target the dragons
first. This is a climactic battle that heralds a new age for
Thylea-you should allow for the possibility that one or
more of the dragons may be killed during these events.

should be terrifying, as his footsteps shake the world.
Rescuing Citizens
Kyrah, Pythor, Volkan, and Vallus are torn between
loyalty to the heroes and their desire to protect the city
and its people. Each time the players undertake one of
the conflicts, two of the dragons will ask to go to the aid
of the people of the city.
If the dragons go rescue citizens, the heroes will
not have their services in the next conflict. However,
in exchange for this show of mercy and bravery, the
goddess Mytros will grant blessings to the heroes that
last for the duration of this part of the adventure. Any
dragons that have been sent away will return before the
next conflict begins.

Splitting the Party
Depending on your heroes' abilities, and your own
comfort in running two separate events at the same
time, you may allow your players to split the party and
tackle two conflicts at once. For example, half the party
might take two dragons to confront Acastus (in The
False Dragonlord) while the other half of the party takes
two dragons to confront Sydon (in The Armies of Sydon).
Splitting the party like this counts as rescuing citizens in
both conflicts; therefore the party should be rewarded
with both of the associated blessings from Mytros.

Signs of Conflict
Once the heroes reach Mytros, they witness signs of
multiple active conflicts and events. Use the following
signs and events to create a sense of constant pressure
throughout this series of encounters.
For example, if Kentimane is coming, then you should
tease the arrival of the Titan by having earthquakes

The King's Dragon




Towering over the city harbor is a gargantuan silver
dragon. His roar thunders across the ocean, shaking
your very bones and sending a chill down your spine.
The dragon crushes several buildings beneath his
massive claws and snaps his jaws at a crowd of fleeing
citizens. Many are crushed by his fearsome jaws.
Kyrah grits her teeth. "It is the king's dragon, Icarus.
He has gone mad with power."


242

Ch apter 9 - The Battle of My tros



As the heroes arrive in Mytros, the harbor is already
under attack by an ancient silver dragon. Kyrah will
recognize him as Icarus, the king's own dragon. Acastus
has apparently fed him all the remaining doses of his
potion of aging, presumably in the hope of protecting the
city from the wrath of the Titans. Rather than protecting
the city, the dragon has been driven mad by the cumulative effects of the potion-and his newfound power.
Icarus will destroy the city unless he can be stopped.
The heroes will stand a much better chance of surviving this encounter if they battle the gargantuan dragon
while mounted on the backs of the four metallic dragons
that they have recently bonded.

Powerful but Clumsy. Icarus is not used to his size or
his power, so he will stumble and misjudge his abilities
during the fight. Every other round, he suffers from
disadvantage, because his mind has not fully adjusted
to his new size. If he wishes to use one of his abilities or
powers, roll d20: on 11 or higher, he may do so to full
effect, otherwise it has half its normal effect either in
terms of damage inflicted, duration, and/or range.
Collateral Damage. You might choose to measure the heroes' success against Icarus in terms of the
amount of collateral damage that they prevent. Icarus
has the mind of a very young dragon, and he gives no

thought to the citizens crushed beneath his claws or
frozen by his breath attacks during the battle. He will
not deliberately target bystanders, but he gives no
thought to them when making attacks.
During any combat round that the heroes do not
attack Icarus, he will kill d10x10 (roll a d10 and multiply by 10) citizens with his trashing about and clumsy
attempts to wreck the city. During any round that he is
engaged in combat, he will only kill 1d10 citizens. The
heroes cannot save everyone, but you can ramp up the
pressure on the party to save as many as possible.

The Mad King
King Acastus, stricken by guilt and unable to bear
watching his beloved city being destroyed, has
retreated to the colosseum. There, he has been joined
by his seven Dragonlord captains, including Tarchon.
The captains are circling overhead, mounted on young
copper dragons. The king is pacing nervously at the
center of the colosseum, next to his adult copper
dragon mount.
The heroes can easily see the dragons circling above
the colosseum from anywhere in the city. Volkan will
mention that the rod of rulership in the king's possession could be a powerful weapon against the Titans.
He doesn't understand why the rod hasn't been used:
Acastus knows how the rod works, but for some reason,
the king hasn't used it to defend the city.
When the heroes arrive at the colosseum, Acastus
stops pacing and greets them coldly.

"So you have returned from your long journey. And
what have you to show for it? Dragons? More dragons.
We have dragons enough in Mytros. Stupid, stupid
beasts!" He kicks his mount viciously. "My ancestors
were fools to fight against the power of the Titans. We
should... we must... we have no choice but to bow to
them! Perhaps then they will spare... some of us."
The king watches you with a mad gleam in his eyes.
"They will demand sacrifices. That is only fair. Fair
recompense for the damage that you've done to them.
But many such sacrifices must be made in the pursuit
of greatness. Yes, I think they will spare me-and my
city-if we offer them your heads."


city. With his last strength, he will hand his rod of rulership to the closest hero and reveal that it is the key to
controlling the Colossus of Pythor.
Treasure
King Acastus carries the rod of rulership. This rod allows
its wielder to take command of the Colossus of Pythor,
which stands guard over the city harbor. Acastus wields
a nine lives stealer and a +1 breastplate.

The Colossus Awakened
Once the heroes have the rod of rulership, they should
fly to the head of the Colossus of Pythor. Here, they can
take control of the gargantuan construct and use it in
the upcoming battles against the Titans. Only one of the
heroes can take control of the colossus, and that hero
is too distracted to control a dragon mount at the same
time. This may sound obvious, but one of your players
will absolutely try to do it! Give the elected player the
statistic block for the colossus. They control the construct in the final battles.

Acastus and his "Dragonlords" will attack the heroes and

You inspect the control sphere at the center of the
colossus's head. There is a slot that seems made for
the rod of rulership. As you insert the rod into the
sphere, you feel the platform beneath you thrum with
power. The gargantuan construct creaks and groans as
it shudders and comes to life. Somewhere deep inside,
you can feel the pulse of mighty pumps and the clatter
of gigantic gears clashing together.
The colossus takes one hesitant step from its
platform, straightens itself, and then flexes its magical
muscles. The citizens of besieged Mytros erupt into
joyous cheers. "The colossus has awakened! The god of
battle has come to save the city!"

The Armies of Sydon




Gazing toward the harbor, you watch as giant ships
plow through trading vessels, leaving nothing but
splintered ruins in their wakes. Cyclopes and gygans
leap from the vessels and run rampant across the city,
tearing down houses as if they were children's toys.
Centaurs gallop through the streets, launching volleys
of pitch-soaked flaming arrows. Ash and smoke choke
the air, and you can see fires burning across the city.




Sydon and two of his children (most likely Yala and
Hergeron) have landed in the city harbor with ships full
of gygans, cyclopes, and centaurs. Their plan is simple:
they intend to reduce the city to a ruin, and any survivors left among the rubble will be forced to kneel and
worship the Lord of Storms. The Titan can be found
at the Royal Gate (M6), accompanied by two of his
children (NE young empyreans). Joining the Titans as
honor guards are a centaur hero, a minotaur hero, and
a gygan hero, all three of which are fitted with brilliant
mithral plate armor (AC 18).


Fighting Alongside Lutheria



The armies of Sydon have torn a path through the city
that leads to the Royal Gate. The walls of the palace
compound are almost entirely ruined, having suffered
repeated blows from the hammers wielded by Sydon's
terrifying children. The Lord of Storms himself looms
over the walls, loudly praising his children's work.
As you approach, Sydon's keen eye catches sight
of you. "Aha! The Heroes of the Prophecy. You have
shown impressive valor for mortals, but the time has
come to face the truth. You are outmatched!
"Look around you: the city of Mytros cannot withstand the power of the Titans. Kneel before me, and
I shall endeavor to find a place for you as servants in
my new kingdom. Otherwise, I can only promise you a
warrior's death."


If the heroes choose to bow before the Titan, Sydon will
make a series of humiliating demands: cast down your
weapons, shrug off your armor, kiss the ground, offer
praises to his name. He does not intend to spare the
heroes-he just wants to see them humbled before he

executes them. He expects the same groveling obedience
and worship from the dragons.
Siezing the Initiative. If the heroes play along with
Sydon and declare to you that they are doing so, then
they automatically have advantage on the first round of
attacks they make. Sydon is a vain creature who believes
that his magnificence inspires obedience in mortals. It
takes him a moment to gather his wits-how could the
heroes, who are so obviously defeated, dare to choose
defiance instead of cringing obedience?
Sydon's Tactics. Sydon and his entire entourage fight
to the death. No dirty trick or underhanded tactic is
beneath them. Sydon concentrates his attacks on the
dragons first, but he always switches his focus to the
creature that damaged him most recently. He takes
every attack personally, growing angrier each round.
Lesser creatures should fall to the ground and worship
him-to attack him is an unforgivable outrage!



If Lutheria has allied with the heroes for any reason,
Sydon declares that she's betrayed him one too many
times. He becomes enraged and focuses all of his attacks
on her, while his entourage attacks the heroes. Lutheria
retreats after three rounds, before the battle is resolved,
but this weakens Sydon and temporarily separates him
from his allies.

Sydon's Victory. If Sydon wins this battle, then the
adventure ends at this point. The heroes will forever
be remembered in fables as the doltish mortals who
challenged a Titan and were punished accordingly. The
party's failure is absolute. If you would like to give the
party a second try, then it must come at a terrible cost-
they may be revived by Mytros or the Fates, but none of
the dragons should survive the ensuing battle.
Sydon's Defeat. If Sydon is defeated, a shockwave of
power bursts from him. The sky darkens, and a powerful
storm rages overhead. Tremendous winds tear through
the streets of Mytros, and rain lashes down, soaking
everything. The rain extinguishes all of the fires in the
city, and it lasts for 1d6 weeks.
Treasure. Sydon carries the Glaive of Sydon. Each of
his children carries a mithral greatsword.

The Glaive of Sydon

Ch apter 9 - The Battle of My tros

The Great Feast




Lutheria glides through the streets of Mytros, leaving
chaos and debauchery in her wake. She cackles as she
transforms citizens into goats, cows, and pigs.
Those around her seem to go mad-falling into
fits of hysterical laughter or engaging in unspeakable
acts with whatever livestock happens to be nearby.
Eventually, the Titan discovers you. Gazing down at
you from her full height, she grins malevolently.
"Have you come to join the Great Feast? I promise
you'll not go hungry." She offers you a spit-roasted
pig and smiles broadly. "Go on-eat, drink, be merry!
What could you possibly stand to lose?"




Lutheria has reduced about half of the surviving
population of Mytros to a bestial state. They are either
transformed into farm livestock, mindlessly engaging in
profane revelry, or both. She shows no sign of stopping

her nightmarish progress through the city.
If the heroes fail to stop Lutheria, then the people of
Mytros will begin the "Great Feast." They roast each
other alive and devour their own families. Lutheria
giggles and explains this to the heroes-it's the greatest
practical joke in the history of Thylea! She repeatedly
licks the spit-roasted pig and offers it to the heroes,
struggling to contain her laughter.
Eventually, Lutheria tires of telling her jokes. As long
as the heroes engage her in worthwhile conversation,
she holds her temper in check. Once she grows bored,
her mood turns icy cold, and she attacks. She is immediately joined by an aurae nymph and an erinyes.
Lutheria and her servants fight to the death.
Treasure. Lutheria carries the Scythe of Lutheria. Her
pockets are full of exotic seasonings, which she has used
liberally on the citizens who have been transformed into
livestock. One of the spice vials contains salt that has
been dried from her tears of laughter.

Kentimane Awakens
If either Sydon or Lutheria has been killed, then
Kentimane of the Hundred Hands awakens to wreak
vengeance upon the city. This battle should be incredibly difficult and may result in deaths among the heroes.
If you want to be generous, you can let your heroes
have a short rest before this battle begins to allow a
limited time for recovery. The heroes will need to utilize
the full power of both the dragons and the colossus,
if possible. Kentimane specifically targets the heroes,
which means that the heroes may choose to lure him
away from the city and fight him at sea.
Sacrifice of the Five Gods. If it seems like the city
might be completely destroyed, then Vallus or Kyrah will
sacrifice themselves to drive the titan back. If it seems
like one of the heroes might be killed, then Volkan or
Pythor will intervene at the last moment and intercept
the killing blow, dying in the process.





In the aftermath of the battle, the city falls into an
unnatural silence. It seems for a moment that the
danger has passed. But then, the earth starts shaking.
The effect is subtle at first: pebbles clattering on the
pavement. The tremors continue every few seconds
and slowly build into bone-rattling earthquakes-the
echoes of gigantic footsteps. Suddenly, four tremendous arms emerge from behind Mount Volkan and
grasp the summit, dragging behind them a gargantuan
form. It's Kentimane, the Hundred Handed Titan!
Kentimane roars and assaults the city with brute
force. The ancient titan is over 100 feet tall and every
bit as terrifying as described in legends. Massive arms
erupt from the ground, opening a path of death and
destruction. Dozens of arms and small heads protrude
from his body, hideous echoes of primordial chaos. He
lumbers forward-directly toward you.




Whatever happens, the result of this encounter should
have an element of tragedy. Use the table below to
describe the collateral damage suffered during each
round of the battle. The dragons will be deeply dismayed
by the damage inflicted by Kentimane, and once the
death toll reaches into the thousands, they may even
become too distracted to fight.

Kentimane fights to the bitter end. He will not rest
until all the heroes are dead, and he will continue to
fight regardless of the damage that he suffers. If the
party manages to defeat him, then you may choose
to have him melt back into the earth, where he can
regenerate and reappear after 1,000 years have passed.
Alternatively, you may choose to have him disintegrate
into cosmic dust, never to rise again.
Treasure. Buried within Kentimane's body is a large
orb of star metal from a meteorite that fell to the earth
at the dawn of time. This star metal has unique properties. If Volkan still lives, then he can use this orb to craft
almost any legendary magic weapon or armor at the
Mithral Forge. The crafting process takes 1 year.

CONCLUSION

You can use the accumulated dead from collateral
damage to determine how the people of Mytros react
to the battle in the following months. High numbers of
casualties result in a long period of mourning, whereas
low numbers of casualties result in great festivities. If
the party sent the dragons to rescue citizens, then just
subtract the number of rescued citizens from the final
cumulative death toll. Mortals who have been transformed into beasts revert back after 8 hours.

The Fates are cruel. With the end of the Oath, death
and bloodshed were inevitable. But with such heroes
leading us, we can build a brighter future.

Ch apter 9 - The Battle of My tros

High Casualties (8,000 or more). The survivors are
grateful to be alive, but they cannot possibly celebrate
the heroes as saviors of the city-what exactly did they
save? They may have even contributed to the destruction. The city spends months memorializing the dead
and years rebuilding. Good-aligned characters should
feel remorseful for not saving more lives.
Medium Casualties (2,000 to 8,000). The city spends
several months in mourning, punctuated by great
feasts. Many of the feasts are in the heroes honor. Major
characters who died in the battle are memorialized with
grand eulogies and funeral games. Everyone looks to the
heroes for leadership-what comes next for Thylea?
Low Casualties (2,000 or less). The heroes are
catapulted to impossible levels of fame. They are living
legends, worthy to be anointed as kings and queens-
perhaps they should even be revered as gods!

Kings and Queens
With the fall of Acastus, the city of Mytros has lost its
king. The Titans have fallen, and the gods are no longer
gods. It's time for a new order to reign in Thylea.
The heroes should now be at an exceptional level of
fame, with shrines or temples across the land venerating
their names. The time has come for the heroes to ascend
to their rightful place as the new rulers of Thylea.

Chapter 10:

The New Pantheon

centuries. They hide behind their walls, laughing at
our spineless lack of resolve. We have the power to

been dormant in the time since the battle. Consequently,
the citizens of Mytros have had time to regroup, and life
in Thylea is just now returning to normal.
At this point, the heroes are perhaps the most influential mortals in all of Thylea. Their time has been
occupied with a number of important activities.

- Ekoh, Ancient Oread

Building Settlements
The devastation wrought by the Titans has left large sections of Mytros in ruins, and many people were without
homes. The heroes inspired many of the refugees to set
out into the world and build new homes. These refugees
founded new settlements, and each new settlement
chose one of the heroes as its patron.
Each new settlement is named after its patron hero.
For example, a hero named Tiberius might inspire the
settlement of "Tiberia." Temples and shrines have been
built in the hero's honor, and festivals are held to celebrate when the hero visits. This is a great opportunity to
make maximum use of the Table of Fame Rewards.
These new settlements can be located anywhere on
the world map of Thylea, but there are a number of
places that make the most geographical sense. Refer to
the revised world map in the Apokalypsis chapter, which
includes markers for seven new settlements.

T

his chapter marks the beginning of a
new phase in the story. With the Titans
defeated and the gods transformed, Thylea
suffers from a power vacuum. Many divine
portfolios-battle, music, wisdom, and more-must be
filled by new gods, or else chaos will rule. The souls of
the dead are adrift, and the storms and seas of Thylea
no longer heed a master. Who will don these mantles of
power and ascend to become the new pantheon?

Break Between Adventures
The next part of the adventure works best if there has
been a break in the story after the Battle of Mytros. This
break can last several months or even several years.
During this time, the heroes have lived through an
extended recovery period in the wake of their quest.
Even if one or more of the Titans survived, they have

Aftermath of the Epic Conflicts
You might choose to run several roleplaying sessions
where players work through the aftermath of the Battle
of Mytros and the founding of the new settlements.
Alternatively, you can ask each player to write you a
letter describing what their character has been doing
during the break.

These heroes are now co-rulers of some of the most
prominent cities in all of Thylea.
New Cities. Additionally, if they have the necessary
funds, each hero may choose to dedicate 25,000 gp to
the settlement that they patronize. In this case, the settlement has already grown into a bustling city, and the
hero is the king or queen of that city.

Running the Adventure
The New Dragonlords
The heroes are the leaders of a new organization of
Dragonlords. As the leaders of such a prestigious order,
they are entrusted as the new "peacekeepers of Thylea."
They are expected to mediate when kingdoms threaten
to go to war and strike against those who would do
harm to the people of Thylea. In addition, they must
create a legacy for the Order of Dragonlords that will
stand the test of time. They must search for worthy new
candidates to join the order and track down rare dragon
eggs that can be raised as mounts for new recruits.
Kings and Queens of Thylea
One of the heroes may have married Queen Vallus to
become the new king or queen of Mytros. Another may
have become the consort to Queen Anora of Estoria.

In this next phase of the adventure, the heroes must
rescue Narsus, the lost god of beauty, from the city of
Aresia-and prevent the legendary Divine Artifacts from
falling into the wrong hands.
The City of Aresia. The party may siege the city with
an army, or they can choose to infiltrate it. Either way,
this is an opportunity for the heroes to demonstrate
leadership qualities and prove that they are worthy of
the mantle of Dragonlords. The city also provides the
party with a chance to explore and roleplay.
Tomb of Karpathos. The party must recover one
of the Divine Artifacts, the Caduceus, from this tomb.
Karpathos is an ancient vampire lord from Aresia.
Prison Fort of Zakroth. The party must recover one
of the Divine Artifacts, the Ambrosia, from this fortress.
Zakroth is a mad warlord who seeks to become a god.

Rescuing the Captive God
The heroes receive a plea to help Narsus, the lost god
of beauty. Narsus is the lost brother of Kyrah, Pythor,
and Vallus. They rarely speak of him, because he is
self-absorbed and selfish-obsessed with the incomparable beauty that he attained when he was transformed
from a dragon into a god. Narsus refused to aid the settlers during the First War, and his family consequently
disowned him.
After the end of the First War, Narsus staged a competition to choose a woman worthy of being his wife. His
suitors were to bring him the silver antlers of an elusive
white stag. Many of the most powerful and influential
women in the world participated in the contest, but the
victor was an oread huntress named Ekoh. Tragically,
she was never able to claim her prize. Queen Calliope
of Aresia became obsessed with Narsus-she took him
captive and fled back to her city.
Narsus has been held in Aresia for 500 years, and
the city of Mytros has launched many campaigns to
recover the god of beauty without success. The two
cities now have a long history of grievances which have
eclipsed the original conflict. But with the return of the
Dragonlords, Ekoh wishes to siege Aresia and take back
her husband once and for all.

Ekoh's Call to Arms
Ekoh meets with the heroes in Mytros and pleads her
case. Knowing that the heroes are unlikely to start a
war between Thylea's two greatest cities over such an
ancient dispute, Ekoh tempts them with a more powerful incentive: her lost love has learned the path that
mortals must walk to become gods.
With the end of the Oath of Peace, Narsus returned
to his dragon form. In the time that has passed, he has
researched a means to reclaim the beautiful form that
was lost to him. He now seeks to share these secrets
with any mortals who come to his aid-anyone who rescues him from the clutches of the Aresian queen. Narsus
proposes to create a new pantheon, with the heroes as
his fellow gods and goddesses.

Ah, Narsus, You were never much good in a fight,
even as a dragon. I am not certain whether it was
a cruelty or a kindness when fate awarded you the
divine power of Beauty, but one thing's for certain:
it went to your head and made you insufferable.
- Kyrah, Goddess of Music

248

Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

MEETING WITH EKOH

reminds them that Aresia is effectively a rogue kingdom
that should be unified with Mytros by the authority of
the Dragonlords. There are a sizable number of soldiers
in the city who would gladly join a new campaign to
settle the age-old rivalry between the two cities.

The adventure begins when the heroes are brought
together to hear the petition of a famous nymph named
Ekoh. She claims to know the secrets of divinity and
wishes to share the knowledge with the heroes. Each of
the heroes receives the following letter:


The Truth about Narsus


Greetings 
I have an urgent matter that demands the attention of
the Dragonlords. I humbly request your presence at the
Theater of the Gods in Mytros. I swear upon my honor
that you will find this matter greatly to your interest as
Thylea's new peacekeepers.
-Ekoh


After listening to Ekoh's proposal, the party will have
much to discuss. If possible, they should consult with
one of the Five Gods. Otherwise, they can consult with
the Oracle-or Aesop from the Dragon Shrine (E7).
Whoever they consult, read the following:




The Theater of the Gods
Ekoh (CN oread) meets the heroes in the Theater of the
Gods in Mytros (M3). Ekoh has a curious verbal tic that
causes her to repeat the last phrase of every sentence.




You find a beautiful woman waiting to meet with you
in the empty theater. "Thank you for answering my
summons. I am called Ekoh."
From her appearance, it's clear that she is an
oread-a mountain nymph. Her skin is like polished
obsidian, while her hair is like freshly-fallen snow. She
stands tall and proud, with sharply defined features
that give her a striking and commanding presence.
"Five hundred years ago, my betrothed-Narsus,
the God of Beauty-was stolen away from me by the
queen of Aresia. For half a millennium, her descendants
have kept Narsus imprisoned in the dungeons of their
foul city. Many wars have been fought to free him-but
the Aresian campaigns have amounted to nothing."
"Recently, my beloved Narsus learned of a secret
ritual that transforms mortals into gods. He now seeks
to build a new pantheon. Join with me to rescue him,
and he will share the secrets with you. Moreover, we
cannot let this knowledge fall into the hands of the
Aresians-think of the consequences!"


Ekoh is vague on the details, she is absolutely confident
that Narsus has the ability to elevate the heroes to true
godhood. The 'divine path' is a well-studied concept at
the Academy in Mytros, but it's mostly a collection of
myths and legends. If such a ritual actually exists, then
who better but a god to discover it?
Ekoh presses the heroes to gather the armies of
Mytros and Estoria to lay siege to Aresia so they can
force Queen Helen to hand over her betrothed. She



"What Ekoh says is true: Narsus is the God of Beauty,
and he is a lost sibling of the Five. But there is much
that she did not tell you.
"Narsus was self-absorbed, selfish, and obsessed with
the beauty that he attained when he was transformed
from a dragon into a god. In his vanity, he lost his way.
He refused to aid the mortals during the First War. For
this betrayal, the other gods disowned him. And when
he was taken by Aresia, it was deemed justice.
"But if Narsus has truly learned the secrets of godhood, then we must take action. That much power is
dangerous in the hands of a rival kingdom. You must
rescue Narsus. You can attempt to infiltrate the city of
Aresia on your own, or you can summon the strength
of the armies of Mytros to aid you."




Versi-or whoever advises the party-admits that
Narsus is not clever enough to lie about knowing the
secrets of godhood. And despite his vanity, he would
almost certainly share his knowledge with whoever rescues him from captivity. Moreover, it is the duty of the
Dragonlords to recover such knowledge.
Queen Helen has no formal diplomatic relationship
with Mytros, and she does not recognize the authority of
the Dragonlords. The only way to treat with her directly
would be through a show of force. Some advisors may
believe that this is a chance to settle the age old rivalry
between the cities of Aresia and Mytros-and to cement
the Dragonlords as the new sovereigns of Thylea.


RESCUING NARSUS

The heroes can come up with their own plan for rescuing Narsus, but the party's advisor suggests the following possibilities:
1. The heroes may break into the city of Aresia by
stealth and rescue Narsus. Refer to Infiltrating Aresia
for details on how this might play out.
2. The only sure way to treat with Queen Helen will be
through a show of force-the city must be sieged.
Refer to Sieging the City for details.

city after so long a respite.
- Vallus, Goddess of Wisdom

If the heroes want to negotiate with Queen Helen for
the release of Narsus, then both Ekoh and any other
advisors will suggest that it is a waste of time without
the added pressure of a siege.
These are only two possible ways for the heroes to
reach Narsus. Whatever plan they end up using, it
should end with them reaching the Chamber of Beauty
(A6). At that point, refer to the Audience with Narsus.

INFILTRATING ARESIA

Infiltrating the city of Aresia should be easy for the
heroes. Once they do so, they might spend some time
exploring the city and asking around to determine
where Narsus is being held. Refer to the City of Aresia
for ideas. Here are some suggestions:

• The party is approached by the Shadowmaster from

the Temple of the Shadow (A8), who wishes to depose
Queen Helen. Refer to her subsection for details.
• The party is approached by the most famous portraitist in Aresia, Pelegon (A20), who wishes to paint a
portrait of Narsus. He can lead the party to Narsus,
but he demands to accompany them.



In order to gather an army, the heroes can use any direct
political power that they might have, especially if they
are kings and queens. As Dragonlords, the heroes can
call upon volunteers to join their cause. They might call
in favors or promise great wealth. The age-old rivalry
between Mytros and Aresia means that volunteers are
plentiful. Feel free to roleplay this process-or simply
ask your players to describe how they want to contribute
in gathering the army.
Preparing the Ships. Once the army is gathered, the
party can launch up to one thousand ships from Mytros
to lay siege to Aresia. Each ship costs 200 gp to outfit
and carries 200 soldiers. The party will need at least
10,000 soldiers to siege the city (a minimum of 50 ships,
which costs 10,000 gp). The costs can be defrayed by
increasing taxes in the city of Mytros, but this will cost
the entire party 1 point of Fame.

250

Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon



The armies of the heroes are arrayed outside of Aresia's
western gate. Aresia is protected from sieges by the
power of an artifact called the Palladium, which makes
a direct assault extremely dangerous. Every attempt
to siege the city during the Aresian campaigns failed
because of this artifact-not to mention the city's
ancient protector: a bronze colossus.

The Colossus




The ground suddenly begins to shake at regular intervals, accompanied by the sound of massive footfalls.
Flocks of birds flee in panic from the nearby forest as a
gargantuan bronze warrior emerges from the canopy,
looming over your war camp.
"Ho there! Come to hassle my little city, have you?
Not on my watch! I am called Talos, and I am the
guardian of this place. What is your business here?"

SIEGING THE CITY
Gathering the Armies



With thousands of soldiers under your command, you
march on Aresia. In the face of your overwhelming
numbers, the citizens of Aresia and its surrounding
region flee en masse as your army approaches, seeking
shelter behind the city's famous 100-foot-high walls.
Dispersing your troops through the woodlands that
encircle the city, your set up massive blockades at
every road and gate leading into it. You station soldiers
and siege engines on the banks of the river to sink any
ship that tries to run the blockade.
With every entrance and exit sealed off by your
army, no one can get in or out. The city's walls bristle
with soldiers. The Siege of Aresia has begun.





Talos is a sentient bronze colossus (Intelligence 12) who
has long protected Aresia. His origins are unknown,
but he has patrolled the forests of the Aresian peninsula
for thousands of years. He protects the city because it
pleases him to do so-he is a gentle giant.
Talos politely asks the party to withdraw their army and
return to Mytros. He hates squishing mortals beneath
his boots, and he'd rather not fight unless forced to. He
strongly encourages the party to find a diplomatic solution.
If the party agrees to try, then Talos happily sits down next
to the war camp and waits for events to proceed peacefully.
Attacking the Colossus. If the heroes attack Talos or
make threats against the city, then the colossus retaliates
and fights until he is destroyed. The warriors on the
city walls will support Talos with volleys of javelins that
target the heroes and their dragons. In the event that
the colossus is destroyed, Volkan is capable of repairing
him, but it's a very slow process.

The Siren Messenger
Queen Helen sends a siren messenger to meet with the
party. She explains that the queen wishes to parley with
the heroes in order to avoid bloodshed. Ekoh urges the
heroes to ignore the messenger and storm the city-this
is clearly a trap!
The party's advisors explain that a direct attack on the
city would result in thousands of needless deaths unless
the Palladium can be removed. They suggest that the
heroes should infiltrate the city and find the Palladium.
They might even stumble across the location of Narsus.

The Shadowmaster
Later that night, Ekoh introduces the heroes to someone who can help make an assault much more likely to
succeed. It is a mysterious woman known only as the
Shadowmaster-one of the queen's spies who wishes to
switch sides. She introduces herself as a loyal servant of
the ancient Dragonlords.
The Shadowmaster knows all of the secret tunnels
that lead in and out of the city. She is willing to lead the
heroes into the city, but she also reveals the location
of the Palladium-it's in the basement of the Queen's
Palace (A2). If the heroes follow her advice and steal the
Palladium, then storming the city will be much easier.
However, the Shadowmaster has her own secret agenda.
Refer to the Temple of the Shadow (A8) for details.
The Final Decision
The party must decide their next course of action.

• Storm the City. If the party decides to proceed with

the attack on the city, then refer to Storming the City.
• Meet the Queen. If the party agrees to a parley with
the queen, then refer to Audience with the Queen.
• Infiltrate the City. If the party decides to infiltrate the
city, then refer to Infiltrating Aresia.

STORMING THE CITY

A direct assault on the city can be planned and executed
in many different ways. Make sure that you are familiar
with the City of Aresia section as the heroes plan their
assault. If you want to make an assault easier to run, you
can use the following two encounters as flashpoints that
decide the outcome of the larger battle.

Battle at the Gates
The heroes are at the forefront of the attack on the
main gates, and they must face off against Aresia's most
famous warriors. If the heroes win, then the gates are
breached and their armies flood the western section
of the city. If the heroes lose, then the gates hold and
attacking army is demoralized. Failure would force the
party to negotiate or use stealth.
The defenders at the gate are Leandros, Halcyon, and
Laertes (martial masters). They are the commanders
of some of Aresia's greatest fighting forces (A2, A6, A7).
They are supported by another three martial masters,
twelve warrior monks, and three mages.
The battle is easier if the heroes have stolen the
Palladium or if they've allied with the surrounding
centaur tribes (refer to Zakroth's Prison Fort). Without
the Palladium, the mages are diverted from the battle as
they try to keep the walls from crumbling. If the centaur
tribes are helping, then they sweep away the warrior
monks and the additional three martial masters.

Battle at the Bridge
Once the gates are breached, the heroes lead the armies
through the street of Aresia toward the palace. To reach
the palace, they must cross one of the bridges. This is
where Aresia's last stand takes place. If the party wins
this battle, then the city falls, Queen Helen is taken
Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

251

prisoner, and Narsus is freed. If the battle is lost, then
the attacking army is routed.
The defenders at the bridge are Taureus (minotaur
berserker), General Niobe (gladiator), and Hiero
(veteran). They are perhaps the fiercest warriors in
Aresia (A9, A10, A11). They are aided by twelve warrior
monks and six martial masters. If the centaur tribes are
helping the party with the assault, then they sweep away
the warrior monks and the martial masters.

AUDIENCE WITH
THE QUEEN

Helen reveals that Zakroth can be found at a prison
fort deep in the surrounding forest. She orders Pyrrha
to guide the heroes to its location. The queen is true to
her word, and if the heroes bring back the Ambrosia, she
will immediately escort them to the Chamber of Beauty
(A6) for an audience with Narsus.

AUDIENCE WITH NARSUS
Once the heroes are finally able to meet with Narsus,
read the following:


The heroes can approach Aresia without an army and
demand an audience with Queen Helen, or they can
agree to an audience if she requests one during a siege.

Talking to the Queen




You gather at the massive western gate of the city,
waiting for your audience with Queen Helen of Aresia.
A small iron grate built into the massive wooden door
eventually swings open-it forms a passageway just
large enough for you to enter single file.
Beyond the gate, you are met by the queen, who is
flanked on either side by three royal guards in splendid
red capes. An additional phalanx of fifty soldiers stand
a hundred yards away, watching the proceedings.
Queen Helen is shorter than you expected-small
and delicate. But her bearing is one of confidence and
her voice is authoritative as she addresses you.
"Thank you for agreeing to this parley. While I
cannot allow Narsus to go free at this time, I will grant
you leave to speak with him in person... but first, we
have an urgent matter to attend to.
"The mad warlord, Zakroth, has somehow come into
possession of one of the Divine Artifacts. Unless he is
stopped, he will raise an army to rival the Titans-he
could even become a god. Destroy him, and I will
acknowledge your sovereignty as Dragonlords."




You make your way down into the underground levels
of the Temple of the Shield. As you descend, you hear a
beautiful, ethereal voice drifting from below.
When you finally reach the bottom, you discover a
massive chamber filled with mirrors of all shapes and
sizes: hundreds of reflecting surfaces in ornate frames
of gold and silver. The floor is layered with a rainbow of
shimmering mosaics.
In the center of the room, a bronze dragon is curled
up on the floor, staring woefully into a large mirror.
Seated beside him is a beautiful siren, who pets him
gently and sings soft, mournful melodies.
As you enter, the dragon lifts his head. Noticing you,
he scrambles to his feet, eager and excited. He lifts his
head and extends his wings, preening and posing.
"Welcome to the Chamber of Beauty, my friends! I
am called Narsus. We have much to discuss!"




Queen Helen and
her Entourage



Queen Helen explains that Zakroth has somehow
unified dozens of centaur tribes into a single army-
something that only Sydon could have done in days past.
Zakroth's forces are already raiding settlements across
the peninsula, wantonly slaughtering everyone.
Queen Helen reveals that Zakroth has somehow
come into possession of the Ambrosia: one of the Divine
Artifacts. She knows that the artifact can be used to
become a god, but she doesn't know the details. She
also knows that Narsus desires an audience with the
heroes, and that the Ambrosia is one of the items that he
requires for his ritual. She wants to assist Narsus, as long
as the heroes promise not to steal him away.

Narsus behaves the same way no matter how the heroes
manage to gain an audience-he's like a proud puppy,
ignorant of all the death and destruction required to
obtain this audience. Although he is initially depressed,
he brightens noticeably at the party's arrival. He's heard
stories of the heroes, and he is excited that they've come.
But he has no real interest in being rescued.
Narsus doesn't care about Aresia or Mytros. He likes
Queen Helen, because she attends to his every need.
He's mostly forgotten about Ekoh. Narsus really only
cares about himself. He wants to become a god again,
so that he can regain his legendary beauty. He can still
polymorph into his human guise, but he's lost the divine
luster that he once possessed.
Narsus explains that he's spent the last few years
communing with his mother, and he's discovered the
secret to becoming a god. He will gladly help the heroes
become gods too, if they will only assist him.

The Divine Artifacts
Narsus needs three powerful items to perform the ritual:
the Caduceus, the Ambrosia, and the Promethean Fire. He
suggests that the heroes start by retrieving the Caduceus
and the Ambrosia. If pressed, he will also tell them what
he knows about the Promethean Fire and give the heroes
a map that shows the location of the sunken city.

• The Caduceus. The Caduceus is buried in the tomb

of Karpathos, the first king of Aresia. Unfortunately,
Karpathos is a vampire lord, which makes retrieving
this item an extremely dangerous task. Refer to the
Tomb of Karpathos for details.
• The Ambrosia. The Ambrosia is in possession of
a dangerous minotaur warlord. The minotaur has
used the Ambrosia to become a charismatic, god-like
figure. He is gathering tribes of centaurs, gigantes,
and minotaurs into his own personal army. Refer to
Zakroth's Prison Fort for details.
• The Promethean Fire. The Promethean Fire is somewhere at the bottom of the Cerulean Gulf, hidden
within the legendary sunken City of the Sirens. Refer
to Chapter 11: The Sunken Kingdom for details.
Finding the Artifacts
The heroes can track down each of these artifacts in any
order that they want. However, traveling to the sunken
city is the most dangerous of the tasks.
When the heroes return to Narsus with the Caduceus,
the Ambrosia, and the Promethean Fire, he will perform
a ritual. While the ritual doesn't turn the heroes into
gods, it does unlock the divine path. Narsus regains his
godhood at this point, and he shares what the heroes
must accomplish before they are able to join him. Refer
to the Divine Path appendix for details.

City of Aresia
The city of Aresia is the largest settlement in the Aresian
peninsula. It's famed for its martial arts temples, impressive walls, and hanging gardens. Located in the midst of
a dense forest of spruce trees, the city is accessible from
the Cerulean Gulf via the Thrake river.
The city's walls are the pride of its citizens. They
reach 100 ft. in height, so that the ramparts overlook the
forest canopy. The river cuts through the center of the
city via a system of gates that can be raised and lowered.
The gates are wide enough to accommodate one fullsized trireme at a time. Aresia does not have a navy, so
there are rarely many ships within the city except for the
traders who ferry goods between Aresia and Mytros.
The city is home to the famed Aresian warrior monks,
who wear red cloaks and bronze helmets, fighting with
spears and shields. They have a centuries-long grudge
against the armies of Mytros, with open warfare breaking out between the two cities every few decades.
The most beautiful feature of the city is its hanging gardens. The gardens are watered by a system of
channels that carry water from the Thrake river. At the
top of the gardens is the palace where the queen lives.
Centuries ago, the first queen of Aresia captured Narsus,
the god of beauty, and her successors have held him
prisoner there ever since.

ARESIAN FACTIONS

Aresian society is centered around the ruling queen,
who also serves as high priestess of the Temple of
Narsus. Aresian entertainment revolves around competitions between the city's martial monasteries.

The Queen of Aresia
For the past 500 years, a queen has ruled Aresia. The
Founding Queen was named Calliope, and she is famous
for bringing Narsus to Aresia. She lured him here under
false pretenses, but he has never truly been a prisoner,
like the stories in Mytros suggest. Narsus is a lazy and
vain god, so he isn't in any hurry to leave.
The current queen is Helen. She closely monitors the
affairs of her palace and the Temple of Narsus, and she
makes the final judgements concerning the city's future.
However, she leaves most of the tiresome governing to
her council of advisors. There was only ever one King of
Aresia-Karpathos, the father of Calliope. His history
was carefully buried. From Calliope's reign onward,
there was never another male monarch. The queens take
male consorts, but no queen would suffer a king to be
revered above Narsus.

The Queen's Guards
The palace is full of the Queen's Guards, a legion of 100
warrior monks who are hand-selected by the queen.
While they wear cloaks in the traditional Aresian crimson, the Queen's Guard cloaks are made of rich velvet,
trimmed in shimmering gold. By order of the queen, all
of the guards are male.
While they are formidable fighters, rumor has it that
the queen prioritizes their physical beauty over their
skills in combat. Each guard must swear an oath of loyalty, and they are not allowed to marry or have romantic
relationships, under penalty of death. They serve for ten
years, and they are recruited at the age of 17.
The Queen's Guards are headquartered in the barracks-two long houses in the northeastern corner of
the palace grounds. In keeping with the Aresian culture, which prizes austerity, the most senior guards are
stationed in the sparsely-decorated underground rooms.
The junior members reside on the lavishly-decorated
upper floors, giving them expansive views of the guards'
training grounds and surrounding gardens.
Commander Leandros
The oldest member of the Queen's Guards, Leandros
(LN martial master), is nearly 20 years older than
the men under his command. He is not particularly
handsome-in fact, there is a long scar running from
his eyebrow to his jaw. Leandros has never lost a
tournament match, though he no longer formally
competes. He has served the queen faithfully for over
two decades. It is widely speculated that he bears an
unrequited love for the queen, for no one else has ever
demonstrated such extraordinary patience with her
capricious demands.

Monastic Temples
Each of the temples has its own culture and tenets. The
temples constantly vie for supremacy in weekly martial
arts tournaments, which the Temple of the Shield has
dominated for years. Aresians have a deep passion for
their favorite temples, as many were raised under one
particular philosophy. When the monks are not at war,
they keep in top form by competing in tournaments.

ARESIAN HISTORY

Aresia was founded before the First War. There is a long
history of tension between Mytros and Aresia.

Royal House History
The royal house of Aresia was founded by King
Karpathos and Queen Nemosyne, five hundred years
ago. Together, they swore an oath to fight for Lutheria in
the First War. However, they failed to appear when she
needed them most, and she named them oathbreakers.
As punishment, Lutheria cursed the king and queen to
undeath, transforming them into vampires.
The entire royal family was consumed by the curse,
with the exception of one daughter, named Calliope.
Karpathos and his wife made their lair in a tomb near
Aresia, hunting by night and preying on the people of
the city. Calliope rallied her warriors and trapped her
parents and their vampire spawn in the tomb.
Thereafter, Calliope took the mantle of queen and
sought peace with Mytros to atone for her parents'
treachery. But then, during one of her diplomatic visits,
she became enamored with Narsus and absconded with
him, causing a permanent rift between the two cities.

The Aresian Campaigns
In the past 500 years, there have been at least twelve
wars between Aresia and Mytros. This number varies
depending on which historian one consults: each city
claims victory in at least seven of the wars. The Aresians
frequently boast that no siege has ever successfully
breached their walls-and this is true, but they have
often been crushed on the battlefield by the phalanxes
of Mytros. On the other hand, Mytros boasts that their
armies are unstoppable on the battlefield-but the
warrior monks of Aresia have repeatedly razed entire
districts of Mytros to the ground.
In spite of this long-standing rivalry, the two cities
depend on trade with one another, and fleets of merchant ships regularly carry goods from one city to the
other, even during times of war.

Narsus, God of Beauty
Narsus is revered by the city as the God of Beauty. He is
egotistical, lazy, and arrogant. Long ago, he abandoned
his siblings and sought an easy life among mortals.
Almost every woman he met wanted to marry him, so
he decided to make a game out of it. He proposed a
contest to kill a white stag, offering his hand to whoever
succeeded at the seemingly-impossible task.
Most contenders gave up the hunt after the first year,
but the oread huntress, Ekoh, was obsessed with Narsus.
She spent years searching for the stag and finally killed
it. Triumphant, she returned to Mytros to claim the
god's hand in marriage -but she was too late.
Queen Calliope of Aresia had seduced Narsus, luring
him away to Aresia, where he's been kept ever since.
Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

255

Ekoh is furious that Calliope violated the rules of the
contest, and she has been trying for centuries to reclaim
him. This is why Narsus must be kept hidden-and why
the walls of Aresia grew to 100 feet in height.
Calliope established the Temple of Narsus to attend
to his every need, knowing that he would be too lazy to
leave. Calliope tricked Ekoh into cutting her hair during
the hunt, and her priestesses use this lock of this hair for
scrying spells, so that they can watch her from afar and
prevent her from assassinating the queen.

KEY LOCATIONS
A1. Hanging Gardens




Located on a hill resting just below the palace, these
gardens spill over a huge, terraced green space. You
can hear the calls of peacocks from halfway across the
city. The garden offers a tranquil space for meditation.
The gentle sound of rushing water rises from irrigation
canals that are carefully hidden throughout the garden.


The gardens are visible from almost anywhere in the
city, and many upper class Aresians pass long hours
beneath the lush, exotic vegetation.
Enchanted Olive Grove. The olives here can be harvested daily. Each olive begins the day as a fresh green
fruit, but it ripens to a rich purple near sunset. Legend



has it that these unique olive trees were gifted to the
Aresian settlers by centaur druids before the First War,
and they are sacred trees of the Mother Goddess.
The Gardeners. The gardeners are led by a handsome stoic named Diocletes (NG centaur druid). He
and his team are forbidden to speak on the job. This
is a rule long enforced by the nobility, who wish for a
quiet place to gather and gossip. Diocletes stands a full
head above his team, and the queen often admires him
from her palace balcony on clear days.

A2. The Queen's Palace




The Queen's Palace sits at the highest point in Aresia,
overlooking the hanging gardens. The architecture is
elegant and free of ornamentation. Beautiful green ivy
climbs up the white limestone walls. The top floors are
open-air passages, where you can often see flickers of
crimson cloaks, as royal guards patrol the palace.


the queen takes many lovers, often her own guards and
servants, though she tires of them quickly and never
lets any of them sleep in her bed. The queen is often the
only woman in the palace. She surrounds herself with
handsome men, hoping to make Narsus jealous.
Leandros (LN martial master) is the commander of
the royal guard. He is usually found beside the queen
at formal functions or keeping a watchful eye on the
guards at the training yard. Due to a series of recent
break-ins at the palace, he's looking for someone to help
him investigate. Nothing has been stolen-yet.
If the party investigates, they discover that acolytes
from the Temple of the Shadow (A8) have been sneaking
into the palace through secret tunnels at night. They are
seeking some way to steal the Palladium.
The Palace Treasury




The grounds include several buildings: the main palace,
the bathhouse, and the surrounding guard towers. Near
the rear of the grounds are the guards' barracks and
the servants' quarters. The barracks house the queen's
legion of royal guards (warrior monks), who wear distinctive crimson velvet cloaks trimmed in gold.
Queen Helen (NG noble) serves as ruler of the city
and high priestess of the Temple of Narsus. She can be
found in her throne room during formal functions, and
her personal chambers when off-duty. The queen is
never seen in public without an entourage of her young,
handsome guards. She is in love with Narsus, who hasn't
made a public appearance in decades. In spite of this,



This marble chamber in the basement of the palace
houses a small golden orb that rests on a velvet pillow.
The room is guarded by twenty crimson-cloaked warriors. The room is lit by seven oil lamps.




The treasury houses a magical artifact called the
Palladium. So long as it is housed within the palace,
all siege weapons defending the city have advantage
on attacks, and the walls of the city have resistance to
damage. This artifact is the reason why the armies of
Mytros have never breached the walls of Aresia.
The Palace Ghost. This ghost appears only at night.
He once served under the ancient king, Karpathos, but
has forgotten his own name. He refers to the heroes as
"Warriors from Mytros" and offers them the chance
to dethrone the queen. He wants the party to escort
Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

257

Karpathos into the palace through the secret tunnels at
night and restore him to the throne. He claims that his
master is generous and will reward them handsomely.
Treasure. In addition to the Palladium, the treasury contains twenty gem-studded masks crafted from
various precious metals, worth 1,000 gp each. There is
also a locked adamantine chest that contains 25,000 gp.
Opening the chest requires a successful DC 25 Dexterity
check using thieves' tools.

A3. Temple of Narsus




This temple is located at the center of the palace
grounds. In stark contrast to the simple elegance of
Aresian design, the building is covered with ornate
engravings and golden statuary.




This temple is full of mirrors, and it has ceilings covered in gold leaf. Despite its name, Narsus rarely comes
here. The temple primarily serves as a convent for his
priestesses. The priestesses of the temple (LG acolytes)
are selected at age 12 for their loyalty to the queen, and
they serve for twelve years, retiring at the age of 24.
They wear silky gowns and scarves wrapped to conceal
everything except their eyes-the queen brooks no competition for the affection of the God of Beauty.
The people of Aresia believe that Narsus loves their
city and blesses them with his presence. Accordingly, the
servants attend to his every need, day and night.

A4. The Gymnasium




The gymnasium is a massive, imposing structure that
stands several stories high. From within can be heard
the echoes of warriors hard at work: heavy grunting,
clangs of dulled weapons, and energetic shouts as they
move through various demonstrations.


Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

Events
• Armed Combat. The most popular and competitive
event by far, armed combat is dominated by warriors
from the Temple of the Shield. Most events showcase
their expertise in the shield-and-spear techniques.
Tournament regulations require spears and other
weapons to be blunted to minimize injuries, but
events are often bloody regardless. There are also
champions from other disciplines, including the
Temple of the Sword. Warriors from the Temple of
Tranquility are famous for taking down armed opponents with simple weapons, such as slings.
• Boxing. The Temple of Tranquility often dominates
this event, which rewards speed and solid footwork.
Competitors wrap their fists with linens and compete to knock each other out. The event uses a raised
boxing ring, and this is the only event where spectators are allowed on the sands.
• Wrestling. This event focuses on unarmed techniques. Fought on mats, competitors follow strict
rules while trying to force their opponents to the
ground to surrender. During this event, warriors
develop colorful personas and complex storylines,
much to the delight of children in the city.
• Shot Put. The least popular of all the events, shot
put competitors throw heavy stones and occasionally
hammers. The goal is to launch them as far as possible. In the past, the Temple of the Elements won too
many trophies in this event using secret techniques,
so they are currently banned from participating.

A5. The Sanctuary




The interior of this large domed building is humid
from steam baths, which have been infused with salts
to ease injuries. Lush vegetation and trickling water
dampens the noise from the nearby gymnasium.



This is one of the most famous structures in Aresia-
and the most highly trafficked. It contains rows of stands
for thousands of spectators, and an open central arena
covered in sand. During the week, warriors come here
to train on weightlifting equipment, but it gets cleared
away on weekends for events and tournaments.
Aresian Tournaments. The biggest tournament happens each week on seventhday, when most of the city
shuts down and fills the stands. There are also attached
facilities for bathing and grooming, and warriors in the
arena take great care to oil their bodies and display their
muscles to perfection.
Daily Demonstrations. While the secrets of each
martial discipline are confined to their temples, the
gymnasium is where warriors train when they wish to be

258

seen. Even on training days, there are delighted onlookers in the stands, whether aspiring young warriors or
older Aresians admiring the beauty of the human form.





This sanctuary is attached to the Gymnasium (A4). It
includes a small shrine for praying to the gods and an
infirmary where warriors can recover from injuries. The
shrine is the domed building attached to the gymnasium
to the southeast, and the infirmary includes the buildings to the north and east.
The Infirmary. Many warriors need healing after
events and tournaments at the Gymnasium. The head
priest here, Lennicus (NE dwarf priest), gambles on the
events, and is it rumored that he makes a tidy profit. He
goes by the name "Lenny," and he considers it his job to
patch up competitors-rather than coddle them - so
they can get back into the fight as quickly as possible.

Shrine of Luck. This shrine offers services including
healing and other priestly spells. It houses statues of
each of the Gods and Titans-competitors come here
to pray "for luck." However, it is clear which gods are
favored, as Thylea's statue is draped with garlands, and
Pythor's is caked with red paint. Narsus's statue is the
most elegant of all, shimmering in gold leaf and surrounded by flowers. Kyrah's statue has some offerings
(including small paintings and music scrolls), but the
statues of Mytros and Vallus are falling into disrepair.

Siren Attendant. Pyrrha is a siren who sings day and
night for Narsus. Queen Helen is intensely jealous of
her, and has attempted many schemes to get her sent
away. However, Narsus is soothed by her singing voice,
and refuses to let her leave. Pyrrha is deeply in love with
Narsus, but all he's ever said in return is how much he
loves her songs. There are whispers that Pyrrha possesses a map to the long lost kingdom of the sirens.
Meeting Narsus. Whenever the party meets Narsus

A6. Temple of the Shield




This temple sits high on a hill just north of the palace,
in close proximity to the city's seat of power. Warriors
march through this area in disciplined formations,
wearing brilliant red cloaks and heavy shields polished
to perfection.




Chamber of Beauty
Located beneath the temple, there is a winding series
of caverns concealed within the depths of the hill. This
is where Narsus (CN young bronze dragon) resides,
attended to by his priestesses and Pyrrha (CG siren
mage). The outer chambers are guarded by twenty
shield monks (warrior monks), but they are never permitted to enter his chambers. Few besides the priestesses have laid eyes on Narsus in recent years, and the
warriors posted here consider it a kind of punishment.



This temple stands at the top of a long, steep path that
winds its way around a forested mountain in the south
part of the city. The temple courtyard is decorated
with white sand gardens and bamboo fountains. There
is little sound except the shuffling of feet and the soft
rustling of wind through the trees.



This temple teaches the legendary Aresian fighting
style, the Way of the Shield. This is the most prestigious
martial arts temple in the city, and masters here teach
techniques that have long challenged the fearsome phalanxes of Mytros. The school's reputation is well-earned;
this is a highly regimented and organized temple where
everything is polished to a spit-shine.
As the strictest of the Aresian temples, discipline
here is a top priority. In order to maintain the image
of the temple, those perceived as soft and slovenly are
routinely culled, no matter how impressive their past
achievements may be. The temple's proximity to the
queen is a symbol of its importance, as their warriors
guard the chamber of Narsus himself, located deep
within the hill beneath their temple.
Grandmaster of the Shield
Halcyon (LG human martial master) reigns as
Grandmaster of the Shield. She is hyper-competitive,
and extremely tough on her students. She expects the
absolute best at all times-from others and herself. She
has mothered many sons and daughters who are now
elite warriors at the Temple of the Shield. Halcyon has
been hard on them, and several of them are resentful.
But she wants her warriors to make the queen proud-
many are eventually selected to join the royal guard.

A7. Temple of Tranquility





This temple teaches both the Tranquility and Open
Hand monastic traditions. Reaching the temple
requires a strenuous hike, but the master here claims
that this long walk facilitates contemplation. Younger
monks who train at this temple are expected to spend
years gathering olives before they are taught any
martial techniques. There is a joke among the younger
monks that the real lesson of the school is patience, as
the master only seems to train those who have turned
gray and wrinkled with age. It is no surprise, then, why
this school has the highest drop-out rate of any temple
in Aresia.
Grandmaster of Tranqulity
Laertes (NG human martial master) has served as
Grandmaster of Tranquility for longer than anyone can
remember. He is a wizened old man with a seemingly
impossible number of wrinkles and a long, braided
white beard. While he never states his age, there is speculation that he is at least 500 years old.
Laertes famously subsists on a single olive per day,
and most of his day is an elaborately-constructed ritual
around this single olive. Most of the monks-in-training
spend hours walking across the city to the enchanted
olive grove, where they pick a single ripe olive at dusk.
They must then walk all the way back to present their
olives before Laertes, who goes through a lengthy ritual
to select a single olive to eat. Laertes rarely speaks, but
the monks closest to him believe that he is on the quest
to find the perfect olive, and he refuses to die until he's
enjoyed it. Many aspiring monks leave the school in
frustration, but veteran students profess the wisdom of
Laertes: that patience is the key to enlightenment.

Grandmaster of the Shadow
The Grandmaster here is called the Shadowmaster, and
no one knows her identity-not even her own students.
The Shadowmaster disguises herself as a jovial innkeeper at the tavern named Jocasta, (LE elven assassin).
This plump elven woman has been the city's spymaster
for 500 years, and her loyalty to the throne is waning.
She's grown tired of the capricious, selfish queen.
The Shadowmaster's Plot. If the heroes ask questions about Narsus while in Aresia, it is likely that one
of Jocasta's spies will notice this and bring them to the
Shadowmaster's attention. Jocasta will meet with the
heroes and try to strike a deal. She knows where they
can find Narsus, but in exchange for that information,
she would like them to help her kill the Queen.

The Shadowmaster

A9. Temple of the Elements




This temple is located near the center of the city, in the
bustling heart of the market district. From inside can be
heard the crunching of rocks, the crackling of fire, the
splashing of water, and the rushing of wind.

Our loyalty to the Lady of Dreams does not
waver, even in the event of her death.
- Chondrus, Priest of Lutheria



A8. Temple of the Shadow




This black temple is located south of the palace, on a
hill overlooking the city. The building is deadly quiet
and unsettlingly still. In the dark of night, it seems to
swallow the light around it.




The most secretive of all the temples, this school teaches
the monastic tradition called the Way of Shadow. Their
members are trained to become spies and assassins,
and they often serve as secret police for the queen.
They move in the shadows, and their exact numbers
are unknown. It is believed that they also have agents in
Mytros, to keep an eye on their rival city.
Cult of Lutheria. It is a closely-guarded secret that
students of this temple worship Lutheria. They keep
several shrines to the Mistress of Death. At any given
time, there are at least three captives here being tortured
for information. The queens of Aresia have long suspected this, but they turn a blind eye to it.
Secret Tunnels. There are secret passages connecting
this temple to the queen's chambers, so that she can
meet directly with her spies. There is also a secret passage that leads to The Red Lotus (A19), allowing shadow
monks to slip into the city inconspicuously.
260

Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

This temple teaches the monastic tradition called the
Way of the Four Elements. They focus on elemental
techniques to control air, water, earth, and fire. Unlike
the other temples, the students here are less combat
focused and instead help with the marketplace and city
maintenance. Water and earth specialists help ensure
that the marketplace runs smoothly, and assist with
stocking and boat traffic. Many of the monks are tasked
with management of the city's vital utilities, including
the aqueducts, the masonry, lighting and dousing the
torches, and more. While elemental monks are not
highly respected as warriors in Aresia, they are seen as
vital to the city's day-to-day operations.
Grandmaster of the Elements
An imposing presence, Taureus (NG minotaur berserker) serves as Grandmaster of the Elements. Tall and
broad even by minotaur standards, Taureus is jovial but
has a keen business sense. While he is trained in the
Way of the Four Elements, he mostly works as a master
merchant, overseeing the bazaar and keeping a watchful
eye out for smugglers.
Master of Ceremonies. Taureus also serves as master
of ceremonies at the gymnasium, as his booming voice
can be heard from even the highest seats. He specializes
in earth-manipulation techniques, and his decade-long
winning streak in shot put is the reason why elemental
monks have been banned from the event.
Proud Minotaur. Taureas has no love for the people
of Mytros, because they keep his people as slaves. If he
learns that one of the heroes is from Mytros, he will
demand to know where they stand on the issue.



A11. Temple of the Sword

Minotaurs in Aresia



Minotaurs are not subject to the same prejudices in
Aresia that they are in Mytros. Minotaurs dwell here
in peace with their fellow citizens, and bulls are never
offered as sacrifices to the gods, out of respect for them.
The Aresians are proud of this fact and lord it over the
'barbaric' Mytrosians.



A10. The Wind Shrine




This shrine is seated on a hill in the northwestern
corner of the city. It appears to be a fortified temple
that overlooks the surrounding landscape, giving a
clear view for miles. As you approach, you can hear the
ringing of dozens of wind chimes.




This humble temple rests on a small hill that overlooks the northeastern gate of Aresia. It has no special
ornamentation, save for the temple's symbol, forged in
iron. Warriors can be seen training in the open courtyard, moving through sword forms in slow, deliberate
movements. Others are frozen in meditation.



This shrine serves as a base for the 1,000 scouts who
patrol the woods beyond Aresia. The general here
shares command of the scouts with the Temple of
the Sword (A11). The chimes serve as an indicator of
robust trade winds, and those stationed here must
grow accustomed to the constant jangling of chimes.
When the chimes grow quiet, it usually signals the
calm before a storm.
The Horn of War. The shrine houses a large bronze
horn that is used to recall scouts from the wilderness. When the horn blows twice, the keepers of the
aqueducts seal the river gates. When the horn blows
thrice, all the warriors of Aresia scramble to their posts
and line the walls with their spears. The horn was
gifted to the city by Sydon, and it is held in place by a
large statue of the storm titan. Sailors often visit this
statue to pay their respects before setting out on long
voyages.
The General
As commander of a thousand scouts scattered in the
wilderness, General Niobe (LN gladiator) has one of
the hardest jobs in the city. While she takes pride in her
work, decades on the job have taken their toll on her.
She is mostly deaf from years stationed in the Wind
Shrine, and the one thing she looks forward to each
week are the tournaments.
Playing Matchmaker. Niobe has a longstanding
crush on Hiero, Grandmaster of the Temple of the Sword
(A11), a reserved man with whom she's worked intimately for decades. She asks him to marry her each year,
but he refuses, claiming that he cannot marry until his
honor is restored. If the party is intrested in helping her,
then they should speak to Hiero.



This temple is responsible for guarding the two northern gates of the city, both land and river. This is the
smallest martial temple, having no formal recruitment
process. The masters here emphasize self-discipline and
training in total silence. They follow the stoic philosophy
of showing humility before the gods, focusing on doing
good work-and most importantly, not complaining or
asking for more. While the shield monks enforce discipline with an iron hand, sword monks are expected to
develop it naturally. The masters only draw their sword
when they intend to cut the enemy.
Grandmaster of the Sword
Grandmaster Hiero (LG, half-elven veteran) never
sought to be a leader. He earned his title after many
battles against the armies of Mytros. During one such
battle, Hiero won an ancient mithral honorblade, and for
years he believed that he was worthy of the sword.
Returning the Blade. Recently, Hiero was defeated
in a duel by the mad warlord, Zakroth, who severed
his right arm and claimed the honorblade as a trophy.
Hiero has lived all his life as a stoic-he accepts his
failure, but it has left him just a shadow of his former
self. If the party returns the blade to him, then he will
be deeply moved, and he will finally agree to marry
Niobe (A10).

A12. The Market




Set between the Boar's Gate and Ram's Gate, the
market sprawls across both sides of the river. It is a
crowded, bustling area filled with stalls and the shouts
of vendors. You can see laborers unloading goods from
ships along the river and hauling them to the shops.




The market is open every day except for seventhday,
widely known as Tournament Day. Aspiring artists are
often seen on Ram's Gate and in the street, hoping to
catch the eye of wealthy merchant patrons.
As the chief source of olives and olive oil, Aresia offers
them at a bargain and sells many olive-themed treats
and goods for tourists. Many of the imported goods
come from Mytros-everything from wine to metals,
cloth, and dry goods. Occasionally, the market draws
Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

261

protestors who claim that many Mytrosian goods are
made with slave labor, but most turn a blind eye, as both
cities depend on a healthy trade relationship.
Zanner's Wine Emporium




This shop is cramped and dimly-lit. There appears to
be an open cellar door in the center of the room, from
which cool, dry air escapes. The racks along the walls
are filled with painted clay jugs.




For anyone seeking wine, Zanner (LG human noble)
is happy to oblige. Originally from Mytros, he left his
family behind to make his fortune in Aresia. Zanner is
a theatrical salesman who pushes his products hard. He
keeps the most expensive wines in the cellar.

• Kalamata Olives (25 gp). Considered the king of

table olives, this is the most popular and beloved olive.
They are deep purple in color, with a tight, shiny skin
and an elegant almond shape. Preserved in red wine,
this variety offers a smoky, fruity flavor.
• Agrinion Olives (50 gp). Grown near the sea, these
rare olives come from some of the oldest olive trees in
the world. Elie sells the light green variety, which have
a fruity taste.
• Aresian Olive Oil (100 gp). A staple of Aresian
cuisine and lifestyle, Aresian olive oil is one of the
most popular souvenirs. Pressed from the small, regal
Koroneiki olives, it is golden-green in color and offers
a fresh and fruity flavor. It's even rumored to possess
magical properties!
Making Potions with Aresian Olives

• Aresian Courage (5 gp). Considered the only true

Aresian wine, this local favorite is mildly sour and
made from plums. It is favored by warriors looking to
improve their luck before tournaments.
• Agiorgitiko (10 gp). The most popular wine in
Mytros. A lush, velvety red with black-cherry flavors.
• Xinomavro (50 gp). A strong wine, popular for victory celebrations after tournaments. This red wine has
floral and spice aromas, and a firm tannis.
• Malagousia (100 gp). A rare wine from Mytros with
notes of citrus, peach, and melon. Queen Helen orders
a batch of this every week.


This shop is prominently located next to Ram's Gate.
It is painted with colorful murals of olive trees, and
it seems to be something of a local landmark, with
dozens of shoppers crowding the interior.




Renowned across Thylea, Elie's is the destination for
olives. Catering to tourists and locals alike, there is an
olive here for even the most discriminating connoisseur.
Elie (NG human noble) is charming and polite to tourists, but she charges them double the usual rates, unless
they have performed some great service for the city.
The Perfect Olive. If asked about the 'perfect olive',
Elie says that the peninsula's centaur druids supposedly
know the secret to cultivating the perfect olive. Agrius,
the King of the Centaurs, is rumored to possess the
legendary seeds of the perfect olive tree.

• Amfissa Olives (10 gp). One of the most common

olives, they are slowly brined with sea salt to bring
out a mild, fruity flavor. They are prized for their soft,
melt-in-your-mouth texture, and work well in recipes
and as appetizers. Elie sells them in a single jar containing both black and green varieties.

Belan's Adventuring Gear




This crowded market stall boasts rows of bronze weapons and armor. Many of the items are marked with the
names and dates of famous tournament victories.


Elie's Olive Emporium


Potions created with Aresian olive oil have improved
effects. Add 1 die of the same type to any roll made for
such potions. For example, a potion of healing restores an
additional 1d4 hit points when crafted using this olive oil.



This shop is run by Belan (NG human gladiator). He
loves to recount the tale of the tournament he narrowly lost to Halcyon, when she won the Grandmaster
title. He was so ashamed that he went into exile for 5
years. He also talks endlessly of Speio, the daughter he
fathered with Halcyon, and he proudly watches her rise
in the tournament ranks from the sidelines.
Belan's Merchandise. Belan sells every kind of
non-magical weapon, armor, and adventuring gear listed
in the 5th Edition Player's Book. Many of the items are
commemorative in nature and come with long stories.
Haidee's Curiosities




This store is surprisingly sparse. A small halfling woman
reclines in a comfortable chair at the center of the
room, reading from a stack of large books.


This shop is run by Haidee (NG halfling mage), who
studied at the Academy in Mytros. After hearing of
Narsus' beauty, she decided to make the journey to
Aresia. However, in the time since she's arrived, he's
never once made an appearance in public. Haidee keeps
her magical goods in a bag of holding.



guards stationed here are friendly with many merchants
and wealthy individuals in the city. This makes them
more susceptible to bribery.





Standing 100 feet high, each of the city's entry gates is
guarded by a dozen vigilant soldiers and two ballistae.
The heavy wooden gates are painted white and set
into solid stone. Each gate is apparently opened with a
system of bronze pulleys.




There are four routes into the city by land. These are protected by large gates, located at the northwest, northeast,
southeast, and southwest corners of Aresia. The fortifications at each gate can accommodate up to 60 soldiers
and warrior monks during a siege.

A17. Gate, Ram's Gate



A18. Noble Estates




This massive gate connects the city to the Cerulean
Gulf via the Thrake River, making it the primary gate
through which ships enter the city. Merchant ships are
lined up at the gate, as soldiers inspect their cargo.


These gates are heavily-fortified and guarded by two
dozen warrior monks. Trading vessels must pass
through here to enter the city. Customs are conducted
between the double gates, which sometimes causes lineups of ships outside the gates.



This gate is just south of the tavern. Consequently, the
guards here are less vigilant. People often sneak them
drinks from the tavern, and the lack of administrative
duties at this quiet gate often leads to laziness. The gate



This is where the Aresian nobility have their estates. In
keeping with Aresian custom, they keep their servants
in luxury, while they themselves apparently forgo such
comforts. In practice, they are no less spoiled than the
nobility of Mytros, but they are better at hiding it.

A19. The Red Lotus




The warm interior of this tavern carries the pleasant
aroma of roasting seafood and spicy smoke. The main
room is dominated by a massive fireplace and filled
with boisterous conversation. An ancient bronze shield
decorates the wall above the hearth.



This gate is painted with the likeness of a lion.



This part of the city is dominated by wealthy estates
with beautiful marble fountains and lush gardens.

A15. Gate, Lion's Gate





This gate marks the northern end of the market. It is
closed for an hour each morning so people can easily be
ferried across the markets. On market days, the bridge
across the gate is filled with artists and musicians. It is
manned at all times by 12 guards (NG soldiers).

A14. South River Gate





This gate is painted with the likeness of a ram.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft.,
one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage. The ballista
has advantage on its attacks if the Palladium is in the city.



This gate is manned by 12 warrior monks from the
Temple of the Elements who take pride in the city and
take their defensive duties seriously. At sundown, the
monks make a patrol around the marina to light the city's
lanterns (thereby reducing their force to 6 for one hour at
sundown). This gate is closed for an hour each morning
so people can easily be ferried across during the prime
market hour.

This tavern hosts a lively crowd of sailors, merchants,

familiar with the Red Lotus-it's the social heart of the
city, and it's much less stuffy than the hanging gardens.

Shield of Stolos. The shield above the hearth is etched
with spiraling meander patterns. Legend suggests that
this shield was once used by Stolos, the famous warrior
who established the Temple of the Shield.
Notable NPCs
• Jocasta (LE elven assassin) is the jovial innkeeper
and barkeep. She is secretly the Shadowmaster (A8).
Jocasta presents herself as an empty-headed flirt, but
she is perhaps the sharpest mind in the city. Jocasta
takes care of her patrons, using her position to collect
valuable information from the merchants and other
travelers who pass through Aresia.
• The Grandmaster of the Elements, Taureus (NG
minotaur hero) can often be found here. As master of
ceremonies for the tournaments, he enjoys boasting
of the upcoming competitions. He also loves showing
off his collection of shot put medals, which he just
happens to carry with him at all times.
• There is often a group of young students from the
Temple of Tranquility, who fill a corner booth and
complain loudly. They gripe endlessly about the
grandmaster, who constantly sends them to fetch
olives and never seems to teach them anything.
• There is a small group of silent warriors with sheathed
blades who appear taciturn and watchful. These seven
veterans are from the Temple of the Sword.
Menu at the Red Lotus
• Appetizer Plate (5 gp). Dolmas, tabbouleh, and threebean salad. Served with tzatziki and pita bread.
• Za'atar Shrimp (10 gp). Shrimp coated in a homemade
spice blend, cooked with a white wine-olive oil sauce
and peppers. Served over rice.
• White Fish Ramen Bowl (10 gp). Seared white fish
and vegetables in a rich, savory broth. Ask for regular
or "warrior style" (no noodles).
• Agiorgitiko (20 gp). The most popular wine in Mytros.
A lush, velvety red with black-cherry flavors.
• Celebration Feast (50 gp). One of everything, plus a
shot of the sour plum wine, Aresian Courage.

A20. Gallery of Paintings




This gallery is a square-shaped building in the northern end of the city with a distinctive dome-shaped
tower. It overlooks the east side of the river, affording
spectacular views from the third-floor, open air gallery.
Inside is cool and quiet. Visitors speak in hushed, reverent tones, admiring the gallery's collection of hundreds
of masterwork paintings.


While sculpture and philosophy are prized in Mytros,
painting is the order of the day in Aresia. This gallery is
entirely dedicated to the art. Notable paintings include
portraits of all the queens, famous warriors (such as
264

Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon



Stolos), various grandmasters, and even the gods.
There are also greatly romanticized landscapes of other
regions in Thylea, from a time when there was less travel
between the cities.
Enchanted Painting. Inside the gallery, there is
a well-guarded painting of the First Aresian King,
Karpathos the Wolf Lord. The painting is rumored to be
enchanted-the painter was so talented that he supposedly captured the king's soul. It is rumored that someone in Mytros wants to buy it for 20,000 gold.
Portrait of Karpathos
If the painting is destroyed, it removes Karpathos's ability
to assume gaseous form. This means that if he is ever
reduced to 0 hit points, he is destroyed forever. This is
valuable information that Jocasta (the Shadowmaster) will
share with the heroes as a way to gain their trust.

Pelegon and the Artists' Guild
Pelegon (LG human commoner) is the most famous
portraitist in Aresia. He has been perfecting his art for
decades, and came to Aresia to paint Narsus. However,
Narsus has refused to appear, and Pelegon has been the
vocal leader of a protest, demanding to see Narsus. He
has organized the Artists' Guild, a group of the best portraitists, landscape artists, and more, who now refuse
to paint for the queen until Narsus is released. Pelegon
offers to paint splendid portraits of all the heroes if they
agree to bring him to the Chamber of Beauty (A6).

A21. Merchant Headquarters




This merchant headquarters is a modest building near
the marina, just southeast of Lion's Gate. Sailors seem
to haul portions of their cargo here for inspection
before it can be loaded onto the ships.




This building is the headquarters for the Coalition of
Merchants, an organization led by Aketa (NG tiefling
merchant). Aketa was born in Mytros and raised in
Aresia. She processes arriving ships and grants commissions to sailors who trade with Mytros. The Coalition
represents merchants from both cities, who work
together to promote trade. The constant influx of gold
and goods has created long-standing stability in spite of
centuries of sporadic warfare.
The Sunken Kingdom. Aketa has long been obsessed
with finding the legendary lost City of the Sirens. When
the party obtains the map to the Sunken Kingdom,
Aketa may reach out and offer to fund the expedition
in exchange for a small portion (10% gold value) of the
treasure. She can finance ships, crew, and other equipment. She offers the party seven scrolls of waterbreathing as a gesture of respect and good will.

Zakroth's Prison Fort
This fortress was constructed recently. It was built to
house hostages from many different centaur and minotaur tribes, who have gathered into a fearsome army.
The army is commanded by Zakroth, an evil minotaur
warlord who seeks to become a god.
The prison fort is a large four-story building made
from logs, dirt, and other natural substances. Plants and
trees grow on the outer walls and roof of the building. It
is surrounded by miles of forest in all directions.

Zakroth, Mad Warlord
Zakroth is a legendary slave-warrior who fought for
Mytros against Aresia in several wars. He slaughtered
hundreds of Aresians, but his master refused to free
him. Eventually, he turned against both cities and led a
slave revolt before retreating to the Aresian Peninsula.
The Ambrosia. During his travels, Zakroth came into
possession of an artifact called the Ambrosia. Drinking
from this amphora grants Zakroth unnatural charisma,
which he uses to manipulate his followers. Zakroth
knows that the Ambrosia is one of the Divine Artifacts,
and he desperately seeks to obtain the other two, so that
he can ascend to godhood.

The Coalition
Thylea's most powerful centaur tribes have joined
together into a massive army, which is currently scattered across the Aresian Peninsula. The centaurs have
been joined by hundreds of minotaurs and gigantes
under Zakroth's command. Together, they intend to
make war upon all the mortal settlements of Thylea, as
retribution for the defeat of the Titans.

The Ambrosia

Hergeron's Chosen. Zakroth's unnatural charisma
makes him a cunning liar. He has convinced the gigantes
that he was chosen by the Titan Hergeron to lead the
gigantes tribes. He also persuaded Agrius, the Lord of
the Centaurs, to anoint him as commander of the coalition army. Zakroth has no desire to protect the outsider
tribes of centaurs, gigantes, and minotaurs-he only
desires more power, by any means.

The Hostages
There are four centaur hostages kept in the fort. They
are the sons and daughters of the chieftains of the
strongest centaur tribes. Their accommodations are
modest, but they have no desire to escape captivity.
They know that they must remain captives in order to
keep the tribes united for Zakroth's war.
Dealing with the Hostages
If the heroes decide to assault the fort there are several
possible outcomes.

• Kill the Hostages. The heroes can kill all of the

centaur hostages. This will ruin Zakroth's plans but
enrage the centaur coalition.
• Capture the Hostages. The heroes can capture the
centaur hostages and bring them back to Aresia.
Queen Helen can use the hostages to negotiate a truce
with the centaur coalition and avoid war.
• Free the Hostages. The heroes can kill Zakroth and
return the hostages to their tribes. In this case, the
future of the centaur coalition will depend upon the
hostages' opinion of the heroes.

APPROACHING THE FORT

The fort is located two days north of Aresia. It is hidden
deep within the forests of the region. This is a dangerous
area that is patrolled by gigantes and minotaurs. Roll on
the encounter table for every day that the party spends
traveling through the woods.

Z2. The Cattle Pen

Read the following when the party arrives:




Through a break in the dense fir trees, an earthen mass
rises above the forest canopy. At first it appears to be a
natural formation, but then you notice the broad entryway at the base. The fortress stands more than one
hundred feet in height, with rough openings that serve
as windows. You hear the sounds of clacking hooves
and the rhythmic beat of war drums from within.






General Features of the Fortress
All of the ceilings are 20 ft. in height unless otherwise
noted. All of the doors are made from wood unless
otherwise noted. There are two types of doors. The
small doors are 5 ft. wide and 15 ft. high. The double
doors consist of two doors, each 5 ft. wide and 20 ft.
high. Opening a double door is trivial for a Large-sized
creature, but smaller creatures must use an action.
Natural Light. All of the rooms are dimly lit by natural light that shines through gaps in the wooden walls.
At night, all the rooms are pitch black.

Z1. The Entrance


The stench of death hangs heavily in the humid air of
this entryway. In the dim light, you can see six rough
wooden crosses laid in a haphazard pattern across the
wide courtyard, with twisted, rotting corpses nailed
to them. Many wear the tattered remains of crimson
cloaks. Flies swarm and buzz around them.

Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon



Very little light filters from the rafters to the central
stair. This appears to be the core of the fortress. Huge
wooden planks have been inserted into an enormous
tree. The planks spiral upwards like a staircase, but they
are spaced more than three feet high. The roof of the
structure can be seen high above, indicating the stairs
will reach as far as the uppermost floor.




The central stair is guarded by Murgrat (gigantes).
Murgrat is young and more curious than most of his
kind. He greets the party and asks their names. Then
he proudly explains that he is one of Zakroth's warriors, and Zakroth is "Hergeron's Chosen." He and
his brothers and sisters plan to eat all the mortals in
Thylea, and then Hergeron the Titan will be resurrected so that he can put the finishing touches on the
gigantes race. As Murgrat explains all of this, he draws
closer to the party, and his poisonous saliva splashes
onto the floor. Eventually, he attacks the party and tries
to eat them.

Z4. The Slaughterhouse




The smell of death and rotting meat fills the air of this
room. In the center of the bloodstained floor are hunks
of meat and the remains of butchered livestock. The
freshest carcasses are crawling with flies, as are several
large pools of sticky blood.



The crucified bodies are Aresian warriors that came
too close to the gigantes fort. Most have been dead for
weeks, but one of the crucified warriors still barely lives,
a dwarf named Ugulat (LN warrior monk).
If Ugulat is healed, he explains the situation to the
party. He describes Zakroth's history, and he says that
the minotaur has clearly gone mad with power. He
knows that the fort is guarded by gigantes and minotaurs. He saw a single centaur arrive a few days ago.
266

The cows, sheep, and pigs kept here are used for food
by the gigantes garrison. They are in a state of perpetual
terror since they can hear the butchering of the other
animals in the Slaughterhouse (Z4).

Event: Returning War party
At some point during the party's time inside the fortress,
a gigantes war party returns. The war party consists
of 4 gigantes and 1 gigantes witch. If the heroes have
left behind any evidence of their intrusion (e.g. leaving
behind dead bodies), then the war party will search
them out. They might arrive as reinforcements to a fight
or just as an additional encounter.





The scent of manure is overpowering in this area.
Gleaming eyes can be seen in the dim lights, and soft
bleats and snorts are offered almost apologetically.
The large space is sectioned off into uneven pens
with splintered boards. Malnourished cows, sheep,
and pigs cower in the corners.





This is where livestock is taken to be butchered for meat.
Currently a minotaur hero is butchering the carcass of a
cow. When he notices the party, the minotaur retreats to
the Kitchen (Z6) to get help from the maenads there. He
then fights to the death.

The carcasses of the animals are hung here to be drained
of blood. The room has been infested by a flock of
twenty stirges which are eagerly sucking the blood.

as a hostage. Lesia attempts to converse with the party,
trying to ascertain why they have invaded the fortress.
Lesia's Request. Zakroth has so far refused to allow
Lesia to see her brother. She asks the party to escort her
to The Prison (Z11), so that she can free him. She cautions the party that the centaurs should be treated with
respect, or else her father will be very angry. Lesia has
serious doubts about Zakroth's leadership, so the party
can convince her that he is an enemy with a successful
DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
If the heroes threaten Lesia, then she will use her
shapeshifting ability to transform into a snake and
attempt to escape through holes in the floor.

Z6. The Kitchen

Z9. The Main Hall





The skinned bodies of a dozen pigs and cows dangle
on hooks from the ceiling, their draining blood dripping
like rain from above. A wide, shallow trough runs down
the middle of the floor, channeling the blood into a
pool where it is collected for later use.










This kitchen is full of sharp knives, forks, and other
wicked-looking utensils. Mountains of raw meat sit on
crushed ice, vegetables are piled in enormous barrels,
and giant tubs of water line the walls.


This enormous hall spans almost the entire width of
the tower. Savory scents fill the air. A huge table sits at
the center, standing eight feet high, with a dozen oversized chairs scattered around it. Six gigantes recline in
the chairs, slurping and smacking noisily as they shovel
food into their mouths with their hands.



The kitchen is managed by a trio of maenads who
were sent by Lutheria to assist Zakroth. They hate
Zakroth, but they will do anything to serve the
Mistress of Death.
Message from the Dead Titan. If the heroes killed
Lutheria, then the maenads taunt the party: "Wretched
mortals, Lutheria is very angry with you. Did you really
think you could kill the goddess of death?" Eventually,
the maenads summon the minotaur hero from the
Slaughterhouse (Z4) and fight to the death.



Z10. The Armory


These chambers resonate with deep, raspy snores. The
walls are lined with large woven mats and giant lumpy
pillows. Two hulking forms are curled up on the largest
mats-the source of the deafening snores.


There are two gigantes asleep in this chamber at any
given time. If awakened for any reason, they bellow
angrily at the party and fight to the death.

Z8. The Guest Den




There is a musty odor in the air, and dripping can be
heard in a distant corner. Worn straw mats are scattered across the floor, and dirty pillows are piled in a
corner. A young centaur woman rests on the bedding.


Lesia (NG centaur druid) is the guest staying in this
chamber. She has been sent by her father, Agrius, to
negotiate with Zakroth. She is to replace her brother

Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon





This room smells of oil and dried blood. Crooked
racks are set against the wall, filled with a haphazard
collection of iron weapons. Dozens of spears and axes
are stored here, of various sizes and designs. Most are
chipped and dented from heavy use.







This is where most of the gigantes garrison can usually
be found. There are four gigantes and two gigantes
witches eating messily at the table. They attack trespassers on sight. When one of the gigantes witches takes
damage, the witches in The Shrine (Z12) are alerted. The
two gigantes witches will arrive within 2-3 rounds, along
with Zakroth and his naiad advisor.

Z7. The Sleeping Den








The armory has dozens of spears and axes that are much
too big to be used by human-sized wielders. The iron
weapons were forged by gigantes, who have spent many
centuries scavenging for the ore to forge them.
Magnet Trap. There is a 10 ft. wide steel plate just
inside the door of this room. Whenever someone steps
on this plate, any metal armor they are wearing becomes
ultra-magnetized, and all the iron weapons in the room
hurl toward them at high speeds. Victims must make
three consecutive DC 20 Dexterity saving throws or
they take (in order) 3d12 slashing damage, 3d12 piercing
damage, and 3d12 bludgeoning damage. This trap only
functions if the victim is wearing metal armor.
Treasure. One of the weapons in the armory is a
bloodsoaked vicious greatclub +1. It has been etched
with invocations in the Giant tongue.

Z11. The Prison




This wide room is lit by torchlight. A hulking minotaur
stands guard, with an iron key hanging from his belt.
There are two portcullises on either side of the main
entryway. Through each portcullis, the sharp eyes of
prisoners glint in the dim light.




I have entrusted you with the life of my youngest son,
Perimedes, to secure the coalition of the tribes. As for your
proposal of war, I agree. With the return of the Dragonlords,
we must be united as one, or else we face extinction.

Z12. The Shrine




At the center of this crescent-shaped room stands
an imposing statue of a titan. The area before him is
littered with colorful flowers and shiny baubles-sacred
offerings. The room is tidy and well kept.




This shrine to the Titan Hergeron is maintained by the
gigantes. Centaurs are disdainful of the shrine-Sydon
long forbade the worship of his lesser siblings. There are
usually two gigantes witches in this room praying to
Hergeron. If any of the other witches in the fortress are
hurt, the two witches in this room are alerted by a divine
premonition. They immediately warn Zakroth and his
naiad advisor, and then all four search for the intruders.

Z13. The Treasury




Zakroth,

The prison is guarded by a single minotaur hero. He
attacks trespassers and fights to the death. He carries a
key chain that opens both of the cells.
The Hostages. Each of the cells contains two centaur
hostages (CN centaur heroes). One of the centaurs is
named Perimedes. He is the son of the great centaur
lord Agrius. Due to their cult-like adoration for Zakroth,
the centaurs view the heroes as enemies. Lesia can
persuade them to cooperate. Otherwise, the players
can persuade them with a successful DC 25 Charisma
(Persuasion) check. If released, the centaurs will run to
the armory in order to arm themselves and then return
to attack the heroes.





Z14. Commander's Quarters




This crescent-shaped room is filled with large furniture
that has been ruined by filth and neglect. An enormous
canopied bed sits against the far wall. Clay jugs and
wooden barrels have been stacked in the corners.




Zakroth (CE minotaur berserker), is usually found
here. He is always accompanied by his advisor,
Belladona (NE naiad). Whenever they encounter the
party, they first try to learn anything they can about the
locations of the other two Divine Artifacts. Then they
summon nearby gigantes and fight to the death.
Sword of the Grandmaster. Zakroth wields a legendary mithral honorblade that he won in a duel from the
grandmaster of the Temple of the Sword (A11) in Aresia.
Zakroth's Statistics
In addition to his normal statistics, Zakroth wears bronze
plate armor (AC 18). The honorblade uses the same
statistics as his battleaxe, but it destroys any non-magical
shield wielded by creatures that he hits with it.
Additionally, the Ambrosia has increased Zakroth's
Charisma score to 20. He can use a bonus action to cast
the command spell, with a spell save DC of 18.



This tiny, cramped space smells of dust, and appears
to be rarely visited. There are large chests and sturdy
wooden boxes shoved inside. The glittering of silver
and gold can be seen in the scant patches of light.


The door to this room is locked. It requires a successful
DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open.
Treasure. The two chests in the room contain a total
of 1,500 sp and 350 gp. One of the chests contains a
letter from Agrius, Lord of the Centaurs:

Treasure
Zakroth carries the honorblade and a bronze key that

THE CENTAUR LORD

Chieftan Agrius

When the heroes leave the prison fort, they are confronted by a band of centaurs led by Chieftan Agrius
(NG centaur lord). Agrius is accompanied by four
centaur heroes and six additional centaurs. He sent
his daughter Lesia to try and negotiate for the release of
his son, Perimedes. If Lesia managed to escape the fort,
then she is here with her father.
Agrius starts by investigating the situation and sending scouts into the fort. The encounter with Agrius can
unfold in several different ways, depending on how the
heroes have treated the hostages.

• Negotiation. If the heroes have taken the hostages as

prisoners, then Agrius will negotiate for their release.
He is willing to swear an oath to disband his army, but
he will remember how the party treats his people.
• Provoking War. If the heroes have harmed his
children or the other hostages, then Agrius furiously
attacks the party, and all the strongest centaur tribes
become sworn enemies of the Dragonlords.
• Swearing Fealty. If the heroes rescued the hostages
and treated them kindly, then Agrius may be willing
to swear fealty to the Dragonlords to ensure a new
generation of peace with the settler races.

I know I should hate the centaurs, but we have
too much in common.
- Pythor, God of Battle

Tomb of Karpathos
This is the tomb of Karpathos, the first and only king
of Aresia. Five centuries ago, Karpathos broke an oath
to Lutheria. As punishment, the Mistress of Death
transformed him into a vampire. Karpathos feasted on
the blood of his queen, Nemosyne, and almost all of his
sons, daughters, sisters, and brothers.
Karpathos and his brood were the scourge of Aresia
for many years until Princess Calliope, his lone surviving daughter, led a band of Aresia's bravest warriors
to the vampire tombs and sealed them up while they
slept during the day. Powerful wizards and clerics cast
magical wards to make sure that no one would be able
to release the undead from their imprisonment. For five
hundred years, the tombs have been forbidden to all and
guarded by elite Aresian warriors.

The Vampires
There are two full vampires in the tombs. One is the
former king, Karpathos the Wolf Lord, while the
other is the former Queen Nemosyne. Nemosyne and
all of the vampire spawn in the tomb were created by
Karpathos; they exist to serve and protect him. Unlike
a normal vampire, Karpathos cannot create vampire
spawn just by draining their blood. Instead, after draining them, he must use the power of the Caduceus.

270

Ch apter 10 - The New Pa ntheon

The Caduceus
The Caduceus is a powerful magical staff that was
buried with Karpathos. It is one of the Divine Artifacts.
Karpathos used the power of the Caduceus to transform
his victims into vampires. The staff is seemingly indestructible. It was buried with the vampire so that no one
else could make use of its foul magic.
Narsus knows the truth-the staff is imbued with the
life force of one of the ancient Titans. It is not cursed,
but its power of life-giving is perverted when used
by undead creatures. For more information on the
Caduceus refer to the Treasures appendix.
Resurrecting the Gods
You may choose to resurrect Sydon, Lutheria, or any of
the other dead gods with the Caduceus. Servants of dead
gods, such as Jocasta, desire the Caduceus above all else.
In this way, old enemies can return to the story with
renewed vendettas against the heroes.

Magical Wards
Several powerful magical wards protect the tombs.
The entire dungeon is under the effect of a permanent
forbiddance spell. No one can teleport into or out of any

of the tombs. In addition, any celestial, elemental, fey, or
fiend that enters the tombs for the first time takes 5d10
necrotic damage. Elves, satyrs, and other creatures with
fey ancestry take half of this damage.
In addition, the door that leads into the tombs is
protected by a permanent antipathy/sympathy spell that
makes it difficult to approach. Refer to K1 for details.

THE BARROWS

The barrows are located a few hours south of the city of
Aresia, deep within the forest of the region. The barrows
are in a clearing that is almost one mile in diameter.




The dense trees give way to grassy hills. A humid fog
hangs over these gently rolling hills, and crows call in
the distance. There are three distinct hills, one larger
than the others. Upon approaching the largest, a stone
pathway can be seen, which leads down into this
ancient barrow. A dozen warrior monks stand vigil,
their crimson cloaks standing in stark contrast to the
dull stone around them.




The barrows are protected by an elite contingent of
twelve Aresian warrior monks led by Yosfor (TN martial master). Yosfor and his band are part of a long line
of warriors charged with guarding this tomb. At night,
they make camp several hundred feet away from the
tomb, because the noises from inside are too disturbing.
Yosfor stops anyone who approaches the tomb
and demands that they identify themselves. He and
his band will prevent unauthorized entry by force if
necessary. He can be persuaded to stand down with a
successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the
heroes have a letter from Queen Helen, then they are
allowed entry.
General Features of the Tomb
All of the ceilings are 8 ft. in height unless otherwise noted.
Most of the rooms are dimly lit with torches.
Heavy Stone Doorways. All of the doors are made
from heavy stone. The doors are circular plugs that are
8 ft. in diameter. The doors can be moved with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Moving the
door means pushing it so that it crashes onto its side.
The fall makes a tremendous noise that can be heard
by all creatures throughout the tombs.
Shadows on the Walls
Many of the rooms in the tomb have humanoid shadows animating along the walls. These shadows begin
to follow the party through the tomb. Eventually, the
party may have as many as fifty shadows following them.
These shadows are harmless-they are the damned
souls of the vampire spawn-but they should be used to
create a sense of tension.

When the party finally leaves the tomb, the shadows continue following them. If the party wields the
Caduceus, then they sense that they have a choice: they
can use the staff to put these souls to rest, or they can
use the staff to swallow the souls. Swallowing the souls
adds one charge of create undead to the staff.
Encounter: The Nuckle
Ten minutes after the entrance of the tomb has been
unsealed, a pack of four nuckle will enter. These horrifying creatures emerged from the ocean months ago
and have haunted the edges of the barrows, waiting for
an opportunity to enter the tombs. They are seeking out
the Caduceus with the intention of using it to resurrect
Lutheria. If Lutheria is still alive, then the nuckle seek it
out on her behalf.
The nuckle will release any vampire spawn that the
heroes haven't destroyed. These vampire spawn come
under control of the nuckle and obey their commands.
The vampire spawn gather in the Main Antechamber
(K4) and wait to ambush anyone who passes through.
This is the order in which they explore the tomb:
1. They release the vampire spawn from K3.
2. They release the vampire spawn from K4.
3. They travel down the tunnel to K5, open the door to
K6 and release the vampire spawn there.
4. They wait for the heroes to confront Karpathos.
5. Once the heroes defeat Karpathos or try to leave the
tomb, the nuckle will ambush them.
Nuckle Tactics. When the nuckle engage the heroes
in battle, they will attempt to grapple as many of them
as possible. Once a nuckle has managed to successfully
grapple a hero, it will use its full move to return to the
Main Antechamber (K4). It takes two rounds for the
nuckle to deposit its victim in this room full of vampire
spawn before returning to rejoin the battle. Heroes who
are dragged to this room may be required to face down
as many as two dozen vampire spawn!
If there are no vampire spawn for the nuckle to
release, then they will track down the party and try to
kill them in the most direct way possible.

A triangular opening sits above the runes, and a dank,
musty scent emanates from the other side.

The entrance tunnel has magical runes etched into it
that create a permanent antipathy/sympathy spell effect.
The following races are impacted by this spell: dwarf, elf,
gnome, halfling, half-elf, half-orc, and human.
Frightening Runes. Forbidden races must make a DC
19 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened by the runes.
A creature who fails the saving throw feels a sense of
dread-they are certain that if they enter the tomb, they
will perish and their soul will be lost. Affected creatures
must move away from the runes until they can no longer
see them. When they are no longer able to see the runes,
they can make another saving throw. If they fail that
saving throw, they cannot make another until 24 hours
have passed. Those who make their saving throw are
immune to the effects for a full minute.
Anyone standing inside the entrance chamber can
hear scratching coming from the door leading to the
Sealed Tomb (K3). If the stone doors are opened, then
the antipathy/sympathy spell ceases to function.

This dim chamber has dark splatters on the wall, and
carries a musty odor. A sarcophagus sits open in the
middle, with a broken stone slab at its side. There is
nothing inside except for rocks and debris. Scattered
around the sarcophagus are the shattered remnants of
several six-armed skeletons.


This tomb has been desecrated. A century ago, gygan
tomb robbers were able to open the door to this chamber. They were killed by the vampire spawn inside.
The vampire spawn were eventually tracked down and
destroyed. The door has never been resealed.





This chamber is eerily still. Several sarcophagi line the
edges of the room, but all are cracked open. A large
stone pillar dominates the center of the room, and a
heavy bronze hammer lies atop a pile of rubble nearby.
Faint scratching noises can be heard from inside the
pillar, as if something is trying to escape.


K5. King's Antechamber


K4. Main Antechamber




Four sarcophagi line the edges of this circular room.
Eight pale, shriveled bodies sit atop them, pinned down
by heavy millstones. Their eyes glint, and they hiss
softly in the darkness. Along the far wall, there are two
passageways that lead deeper into the tombs.


There is little inside this chamber except for rubble and
the overwhelming scent of musk. It is circular, like the
other chambers, but has no sarcophagi or columns.
Two circular stone doors lie ahead, with no markings
to indicate where they lead. The only sign of life is a
cockroach that skitters off into the darkness.



The central pillar in this room has been sealed for centuries. A few good hits from the hammer will loosen the
bricked-up pillar to a point where the creatures trapped
inside are finally able to force their way out.
Trapped Undead Servants. The inside of the pillar is
packed with undead. There are twelve vampire spawn,
all pressed together in such a way that they can hardly
move. These vampire spawn were all commanders and
guards of queen Nemosyne. If the bricked-up opening is
broken, six of the vampire spawn fall into the room and
attack the party immediately. The other six are able to
claw free and join the battle one round later.
Shadows on the Walls. There are twelve humanoid
shadows that animate along the walls of this tomb.
These shadows are incorporeal, but they begin following the party throughout the tomb. The shadows are
difficult to see at first-a passive Perception score of 15
or higher is required to notice them.



The eight bodies are vampire spawn. These vampire
spawn are all cousins of queen Nemosyne. The vampire
spawn are unable to move and are considered paralyzed. Removing a millstone requires a successful DC 15
Strength (Athletics) check.
Shadows on the Walls. There are eight humanoid
shadows that animate along the walls of this room.
These shadows are incorporeal, but they begin following

They are pinned down by enormous millstones. Two
passageways are blocked by stone doors along the far
wall of the sepulcher.




The passage in this chamber runs for 200 ft. until it ends
in the tomb of Nemosyne. The six bodies held down
by stone millstones are vampire spawn. They are all
brothers and sisters of Queen Nemosyne. A successful
DC 15 History check will reveal their identities. The
vampire spawn are unable to move and are considered
paralyzed. Removing a millstone requires a successful
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
Shadows on the Walls. There are six humanoid shadows that animate along the walls of this room. These
shadows are incorporeal, but they begin following the

K7. The Dread Boar




The stench in this room is overwhelmingly pungent,
made worse by the dank, humid air. It is the unmistakable foulness of death, and it emanates from a hulking,
half-rotten boar that hangs from the ceiling. The boar
is enormous, and it is displayed with reverence. It
seems to be some sort of hunting trophy.




This body of the sacred boar was the Wolf Lord's most
coveted trophy. It was cursed by Lutheria and is now
a dread boar. If anyone enters the chamber, the dread
boar will come alive after 1 minute and rip itself down
from the ceiling. It fights to the death.







A thick layer of filth covers the floor, and the stench of
refuse fills the air. Patches of grass and mud have been
matted into beds by some sort of beast. Enormous
piles of half-gnawed bones are scattered throughout
the room, picked clean of flesh.




This chamber is the den of Karpathos's dread wolves, but
they are not currently here.
Grasping Skeletons. The scattered bones are actually
hundreds of skeletons that have been packed into the
floor. These are ancient victims of the vampires. As the
party moves across the room, the skeletons grasp at the
party's ankles with their bony hands. Each hero must make
a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained
by a skeleton. Once a skeleton has restrained a hero, it
tries to drag the hero down into the bone pit. This takes 2
rounds, and it can be prevented by destroying the skeleton.
If the skeleton succeeds, then the hero must hold their
breath or they begin to suffocate beneath the bones.



Two enormous wolves dominate this sepulcher, and
their deathly stench is palpable. A huge pillar stands
in the center of the chamber, inlaid with red stone
and green alabaster. An opening in the pillar has
been bricked over. Near the pillar lies an adamantine
hammer with a wolf's head design.




The two dread wolves are large enough to fill most of
the room. They won't attack unless someone attacks
them first, but they snarl at trespassers.
Awakening the Wolf Lord
Karpathos (NE warrior vampire) is sealed up in the
central pillar. One hit from the adamantine hammer will
break the sealed door and dissipate the magic that has
kept the Wolf King imprisoned for two centuries. The
sarcophagus is his resting place, and he will return here
in mist form when reduced to 0 hit points.




Inside the pillar, there is an open sarcophagus with a
kingly figure resting inside. The ancient vampire lord
opens his eyes and gazes at you with cold intensity.
In his right hand, he carries an ancient staff with two
wings and two twisting dragons.

Karpathos the
Wolf Lord




Karpathos wields the Caduceus. He can use a bonus
action to touch another undead creature and cause it to
regain 100 hit points. This includes undead that have
been reduced to 0 hit points. He will use it to return his
dread wolves to life if they have been destroyed.
Family Reunion. If Karpathos is losing the battle, he
will try to find Queen Nemosyne. He uses misty escape to
flee to the Sepulcher of Nemosyne (K14), slipping through
any sealed doors along the way. Once he finds his queen,
he will free her and then all of the vampire spawn in the
Chamber of Children (K12). The entire family of vampires
then seeks out the party and attempts to ambush them.

K10. Queen's Antechamber




This circular room has two stone doors, neither of
which bear any markings. The chamber is scattered
with rubble and many corroded bronze trinkets.




The corroded trinkets in this room were ancient offerings buried with the original occupants of the tomb,
before the vampires were locked away here. One of the
items scattered in the rubble is an eversmoking bottle.
Passageways. This chamber has two passageways that
lead elsewhere in the tomb. One leads back to the Main

each statue is made in the image of a different woman.
They strike elegant poses, as if dancing or strumming
instruments. The room smells strongly of oil.

The golden statues are all keledone. When any living
creature enters the chamber, four keledone activate.
Wings will unfurl from their backs and they will use
their song of pain against the intruders. The remaining
keledone will not activate unless attacked. Once all of
the active keledone are destroyed, intruders have an
hour before the remaining keledone will become active
and hunt down any living creatures that remain in the
tombs. The keledone ignore undead entirely.

K14. Sepulcher of Nemosyne




An ornately carved sarcophagus rests on a dais in the
center of this room, and light filters down onto it from
above. A pale, motionless figures rests inside it. She is
dressed in a fine but faded crimson dress, embroidered
with intricate golden designs. She would seem asleep if
not for the enormous millstone on her chest. The room
smells of dust and the putrid odor of rot.



Nearly two dozen child-sized sarcophagi line this room.
The center of the room is dominated by a painted
pillar, but its murals have long since faded. You can
hear the faint sounds of pitiful crying and sniffling
coming from within the pillar.




The four bodies held down by heavy millstones are
vampire spawn. They were the personal guards of the
queen. The vampire spawn are unable to move and are
considered paralyzed. Removing a millstone requires a
successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
Shadows on the Walls. There are four humanoid
shadows that animate along the walls of this tomb.
These shadows are incorporeal, but they begin following
the party throughout the tomb.

K12. Chamber of Children




Four stone sarcophagi are set in the center of this
room, and four warriors in heavy bronze breastplates
lie atop them, garbed in faded crimson cloaks. Each
warrior is weighed down by a heavy millstone.





Imprisoned within the pillar are Queen Nemosyne's
many young children, nephews, and nieces. They are all
vampire spawn. There are twenty of them. All of them
look like children from the age of six to ten. If they are
released, they will pour out and attack trespassers without mercy. Five of them emerge each round.
Shadows on the Walls. There are twenty child-sized
shadows that animate along the walls of this tomb.
These shadows are incorporeal, but they begin following
the party throughout the tomb.



Queen Nemosyne is a spellcaster vampire. While the
millstone sits on her chest, she is unable to move and is
considered paralyzed. Removing the millstone requires
a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The sarcophagus is her resting place, and she will return here in
mist form when reduced to 0 hit points.
Family Reunion. When Queen Nemosyne is released,
she immediately moves to the Chamber of Children
(K12) and breaks open the pillar to release the vampire
spawn. The twenty children will then join her as she
tries to hunt down and kill the intruders.
The Queen's Cape. Queen Nemosyne wears a cape
of the mountebank, which allows her to cast dimension
door once per day. She may use this to reach K12 as
soon as the millstone is removed from her chest.

It was unthinkably brave of Queen Calliope to lock her cursed family away in the tombs. How many young warriors
would have the stomach to do such a thing? The people of Mytros spit on the names of the Aresian queens, but I have
great respect for Calliope, who possessed the strength of will both to save her city and to seize the god of beauty.

Chapter 11:

The Sunken Kingdom
"The sirens have spent thousands of years
singing of their lost city, but none would recognize
it now, broken and shattered in the depths of the
ocean. There are places there that light cannot
reach-shadows where an ancient hunger sleeps."

T

-Versi, Oracle of Thylea

his chapter begins when the party
decides to seek out one of the lost Divine
Artifacts-the Promethean Fire. Recovering
this artifact is a major undertaking that
requires the party to dive deep beneath the oceans and
explore the legendary Sunken Kingdom. There they
will meet forgotten gods and face primordial dangers,
including the monster Scylla, bane of the ancient seas.

Running the Adventure
Before traveling to the Sunken Kingdom, the party
will need a map to its location. Pyrrha, a siren from
Aresia, has long possessed just such a map. She attends
to Narsus in the Chamber of Beauty (A6). Refer to the
Audience with Narsus in Chapter 10 for details.
Once the party has obtained the map, they can set
out on an expedition to find the sunken city. They
276

Ch apter 11 - The New Pa ntheon

will need a crewed ship and some means by which to
explore underwater for long periods of time. Aketa at
the Merchant Headquarters (A21) in Aresia is willing to
provide magic and equipment to assist with the quest.
Versi, the Oracle, is also more than willing to assist, as
she has long been curious about the sunken city.
Here is an overview of this chapter:

• The Sunken City. The party must sail to the loca-

tion of the sunken city, anchor the ship, and dive to
the ocean floor. They must speak with the merfolk
in the ruins of the city to learn the location of the
Promethean Fire. The merfolk are fighting a war
against a terrifying merrow tribe.
• The Temple District. The party must investigate this
ruined district, where a pantheon of long-forgotten
gods have been sealed away. They tell the party the
story of Phaeros, an angelic being who carries the
Promethean Fire. He and the artifact were swallowed
by Scylla thousands of years ago.
• The Chasm. The party must descend into the darkest fathoms of this ancient trench in order to destroy
Scylla and rescue Phaeros. But Phaeros has gone mad
after spending thousands of years trapped in the belly
of the beast. The party must defeat him to recover the
Promethean Fire.

Lost City of the Sirens
The Sunken Kingdom is a city that was swallowed by the
ocean, thousands of years ago. It is all that remains of
one of Thylea's most powerful and ancient civilizations.
The city is the original home of the siren race, and it was
once a place of great beauty. But when disaster befell the
city, it sank to the floor of the Cerulean Gulf. There are
many poems and songs that purport to tell the tale of
the city's destruction. The truth is known to only a few.
The Legend of the Sirens
If the heroes are not familiar with the legend of the
sunken city, then you might have Pyrrha sing the story
to them. Refer to the Legend of the Sirens in the Playable
Races appendix for details.

Location of the Kingdom
The Sunken Kingdom is located a few miles west of
Yonder and north of Exile Island.
The city stretches across a relatively shallow part
of the ocean, only a few hundred feet below sea level.
Sunlight filters through the water and provides light.
The elegant marble architecture of the sirens has been
amazingly resilient, despite centuries under the ocean.
Coral has grown over many sections of the city, adding
to its ethereal beauty.

The Forgotten Gods
The city is no longer populated by sirens. It is now the
domain of a merfolk kingdom. The merfolk worship
a group of powerful godlike beings that are seemingly
trapped in the ancient temple ruins of the city. While
these 'gods' are unable to grant spells, they do perform
feats of magic for the merfolk and grant them magical
items as rewards. The godlike beings are singularly
focused on retrieving something that was lost at the
bottom of a great rift in the center of the city. This rift is
known as the Chasm, and it is the domain of a terrifying
creature called Scylla.

War for the Ruins
In recent years, the Sunken Kingdom has been ravaged
by war. A century ago, a tribe of merfolk descended
into the Chasm at the request of their gods. They never
returned and were presumed to have been eaten by
Scylla. A few years ago, the tribe miraculously emerged
from the Chasm, but in a form that was unrecognizable to the merfolk. They were now merrow: twisted,
malevolent versions of merfolk. The creatures immediately went to war against the merfolk. Their motives are
unclear, but they are known to throw some of the bodies
of their victims into the depths of the Chasm.

UNDERSEA FACTIONS
The Merfolk
The merfolk kingdom is the largest underwater civilization in all of Thylea. There are thousands of merfolk that
live in and amongst the ruins of the Sunken Kingdom.
The city is able to support such numbers due to the vast
forests of kelp and coral.
Alongside the merfolk is a tribe of nereid that tend to
the coral and kelp forests. They are fiercely protective
of these natural wonders and often join the merfolk in
battle against the merrow.

The Merrow
The merrow are sadistic predators that live to kill
and cause mayhem. Unbeknownst to the merfolk, the
merrow were twisted by the evil beast known as Scylla
that dwells at the bottom of the Chasm. They now serve
to provide her with food. For this purpose they hunt
merfolk, whales, dolphins and other mammalian sea
creatures. Those that they don't devour themselves they
discard into the Chasm. Several sea hag covens have
come to serve the merrow warlord.

UNDERWATER
EXPLORATION

As the heroes explore the Sunken Kingdom, remember
the following rules for underwater exploration:

• Fire Resistance. Creatures and objects located underwater have resistance to fire damage.

• Melee Attack Penalties. When making a melee

weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has
disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a
dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
• Ranged Attack Penalties. Ranged weapon attacks
automatically miss targets beyond the weapon's
normal range. Even against a target within normal
range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the
weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a thrown weapon
(javelins, spears, tridents, darts, etc.)
Additional rules for deep underwater exploration are
provided in The Chasm section.
Expedition to the City
Treat this part of the adventure like an expedition into
uncharted underwater territory. The party should bring a
ship and a crew, with 1 mile mithral chains for hauling up
treasure. The party will need access to the water breathing spell or some other means to survive underwater for
long periods of time. Magical light will also be required.

KEY LOCATIONS

Approaching the Sunken City
Read the following when the players descend into the
ocean and approach the sunken city:


L1. Merfolk Palace


As you descend into the murky depths of the ocean,
a glorious city slowly emerges through the dimly lit
waters. Towers, spires, domes and other magnificent
structures are spread out across the ocean floor in a
sprawling metropolis, still largely intact despite centuries beneath the waves. The basic architecture of the
city has been overgrown with brightly colored coral
that only accentuates the sunken city's beauty.
On the south-east edge of the city, however, is a
dark, gaping maw: an open chasm that extends deep
into the ocean floor, swallowing up all light that enters.




Event: Massacre!
Run this event when the party first arrives in the city.


As you near the edge of the sunken city, you come
across a scene of brutal violence: a score of merfolk are
under attack from a hideous war party of merrow.
Wielding tridents and nets, the merfolk fight valiantly against their twisted brethren, but the merrow
are bigger, stronger, and far more savage. Several of
the merfolk are already badly wounded, with plumes of
their blood slowly seeping into the surrounding waters.
Unaware of the interlopers, one of the evil merfolk plunges a long spear into the belly of a hapless
mermaid soldier, who cries out and clutches feebly
at the thick shaft now protruding from her stomach.
The merrow twists the weapon, then rips it free; the
mermaid shudders once then goes still.


There are 20 merfolk under attack by a war party of
10 merrow. Five of the merfolk are already dead. If the
heroes come to the aid of the merfolk, they will try to
convince the party to have an audience with their king.
If the heroes agree to the audience, then the merfolk
lead the party to the Merfolk Palace (L1).

Random Encounters
For every hour that the party explores the sunken city,
there is a 10% chance that one of the following groups
of sea creatures will swim by in close proximity. The
creatures do not necessarily attack.

• Two giant sharks
• Herd of twelve hunter sharks
• Swarm of twenty giant octupuses

278

Ch apter 11 - The New Pa ntheon



Rising up above the surrounding structures is a magnificent palace. The high walls and circular towers on each
corner are covered with multi-colored coral, carefully
groomed and tended so that it grows in a pattern that
forms a peculiar symbol: a pair of crossed tridents
above a giant squid.
The iron gates of the palace stand open, but several
heavily-armored merfolk stand guard outside to dissuade anyone from entering without invitation.









The palace is the most heavily-defended building in the
kingdom. There are two dozen merfolk and a dozen
nereid who garrison it at all times. The ruler of the
merfolk is a powerful warrior-king named Pontus (LG
merfolk gladiator with the amphibious trait and a swim
speed of 40 feet).
Event: Meeting the King
If the heroes agree to an audience with the merfolk king,
then they will be escorted into the palace.




Escorted by six guards on either side, you enter
the palace and are led to the throne room. A kingly
merman sits upon a golden chair, his powerful tail
curled up beneath him. A thick white beard covers his
face, and a bejeweled silver crown rests upon his brow.
Scattered about the throne room are more guards,
as well as other members of the royal court. A young
merman swims forward and calls out in a loud voice:
"On behalf of the merfolk people of the Sunken
Kingdom, King Pontus welcomes you!"
Pontus tilts his head in your direction and fixes you
with his dark, probing eyes. "It has been many years
since we have had visitors from the surface world. Tell
me, why are you here?"





King Pontus is grateful that the party have rescued his
loyal servants. He answers any questions that the party
pose to him, and he provides valuable information:
The Chasm. The Chasm (L9) descends more than a
mile into the depths of the ocean. It is the home of the
deadliest predators in the ocean, including giant sharks
and enormous sea snakes. But the deadliest thing in the
Chasm is a monstrosity known as Scylla.
The Lost Gods. The merfolk worship gods that have
lived in the ruins of the city since before the merfolk
arrived. The gods may be willing to assist the heroes with
their quest. They can be found in the Temple District (L8).



Ch apter 11 - The New Pa ntheon

279

The King's Request
Once the heroes have finished with their questions, the
king asks for a favor. He recognizes that the heroes are
powerful warriors who could strike a finishing blow
against the evil merrow tribes. He begs the heroes
to bring an end to the war by assaulting the Merrow
Fortress (L6) and killing the warlord, Sheksis. He warns
the party that she is in league with a coven of hags.
If the heroes agree, the king assigns a war party of
nereid to accompany them. There is one nereid per
hero. Both the heroes and the nereid are given giant sea
horses as mounts. The assault on the merrow fortress is
something that should be quite easy for the heroes.

L2. Merfolk Village




Many of the homes that were destroyed when the
nameless city sank beneath the ocean have since been
repaired and rebuilt by the current undersea denizens,
creating new neighborhoods and districts. Merfolk
merchants hawk their wares in corner markets while
ordinary citizens swim up and down the streets, consumed by the mundane bustle of ordinary life.


The merfolk live in large families of up to a dozen. The
nereid intermingle with the merfolk, though they live in
their own private abodes. The party can purchase basic
supplies at the merfolk shops here.
Everburning Globes. One of the items that the party
can purchase are everburning globes. These are glowing
red orbs that have been permanently enchanted with the
light spell. The merfolk use these globes to light the city,
but they could also be used to light the way when diving
into the darkest fathoms of the Chasm. They can be
purchased for 10 gp each.

L3. Coral Farm


Tall, delicate towers of coral rise up from the ocean
floor. Shaped and sculpted into evocative designs, the
colorful growths resemble a beautiful meditative garden.


The coral farms are guarded by six nereid. Merfolk
come here to herd fish into their nets.
Curious Nereid. One of the nereid here takes an
interest in the party. Her name is Kaila (CG), and she
wishes to visit the Temple of the Fish Queen (D4) to pay
her respects. She asks whether the party will allow her
to accompany them. Kaila has an intense dislike for
oceanids and will strongly discourage the party from
trusting them.





This tall tower is covered with a random but spectacular pattern of coral in a rainbow of hues. Schools of
vibrantly colored fish circle the tower like living decorations, further adding to the towers wild, untamed
beauty.




A dozen oceanid call this tower home. Only 1d4 oceanids are here at any given time. The others are exploring
the oceans or the Thylean coasts.
Curious Oceanid. One of the oceanids here takes an
interest in the party. His name is Vyron (CN). He has
heard tales of a legendary trickster god who dwells in
the Temple District (D8), and he wishes to meet him.
He asks to accompany the party. In exchange, Vyron
offers to guide the party to a secret shrine where all the
ancient treasures of the sunken city are hidden. This is
the Forbidden Shrine (L6). Vyron fails to mention that
the shrine is dangerous and forbidden.

L5. Kelp Forest




L4. Oceanid Lairs







Towering stalks of kelp rise from the dark fissures that
divide the city. The thick vines and wide, flat leaves
wave gently back and forth with the shifting currents,
almost as if beckoning you to enter. But on closer
inspection, you can see the densely packed aquatic
vegetation has tangled together, forming a nearly
impenetrable curtain that obscures whatever dangers
may be lurking within.




The kelp forest is a no man's land between the merfolk
settlements and the merrow territory. While the forest
used to be a major source of food for the merfolk, it has
become very dangerous for those who have to harvest
the kelp. Violent clashes between merrow and merfolk
are nearly a daily event.
The kelp restricts visibility significantly. The entire
forest is considered lightly obscured. There is a 20%
chance per hour of being ambushed by a war party of
merrow. The war party consists of twelve merrow led by
a single sea hag.

We have long known of the existence of the merfolk,
but we have paid them little heed. Perhaps that
was a mistake. There are powers below the oceans
that we have not yet begun to reckon with, and they
know more of these things than we do.

Ch apter 11 - The New Pa ntheon

- Vallus, Goddess of Wisdom

L6. Forbidden Shrine


L7. Merrow Fortress




This opulent shrine is surrounded by golden statues
of winged sirens. In contrast to the surrounding ruins,
it appears to be in pristine condition. Standing in the
entrance of the shrine, you think you can hear the faint
sounds of beautiful singing coming from inside.


This shrine is unguarded and empty. The inside of
the shrine is lavishly decorated with marble statues,
gemstone mosaics, and silver ornamentation. Merfolk
skeletons are scattered across the floor.
The Forgotten Name. Written in mosaics on the rear
wall of the shrine is the forgotten name of the sunken
City of the Sirens. The name has been cursed by Sydon,
and attempting to read it requires the reader to make a
DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the reader
experiences a terrifying vision of the city collapsing and
being swallowed by the ocean. The reader believes that
they are drowning, even if they can breathe water. Use
the rules for suffocation. The reader repeats the saving
throw each round until they succeed or until they are
reduced to 0 hit points. Succeeding on the saving throw
reveals that the name of the city literally cannot be
read-it has been erased from history by magic.
Treasure. The shrine is filled with ancient treasure
chests, which the merrow have no use for. There are
twelve chests, containing a total of 24,000 sp and 12,000
gp. Scattered throughout the chests are six star rubies
and six star sapphires, each worth 1,000 gp.



Near the edge of the great Chasm stands a dark and
foreboding building, which rears up from the ruins on
the edge of the sunken city. Though massive in size,
its shape is flat and functional-there is no beauty or
elegance in its construction. The gray marble facade is
bereft of the coral patterns that mark the other buildings of the sunken city.







The merrow have fortified this building with marble
taken from the surrounding ruins. At any given time
there are 40 merrow within the fort. The merrow are
ruled by a warlord named Sheksis (CE merrow, maximum HP, 18 AC). Sheksis has a coral horn that she can
blow to summon 1d4 giant sharks from the depths of
the chasm. She is served by a coven of three sea hags.
If the merrow fortress is attacked, Sheksis will send all
of the merrow out to do battle while she summons giant
sharks. Five rounds into the battle against the merrow,
the warlord will arrive with the coven of sea hags and
any sharks that she has summoned.
The King's Trident. Sheksis wields a trident of fish
command, which rightfully belongs to King Pontus.

Ch apter 11 - The New Pa ntheon

The Temple District
Thousands of years ago, an angel was cast out from the
heavens for believing that the secrets of divinity should
be given to the mortal races. His name was Phaeros
(CN solar). Before he was exiled, he managed to steal
the Promethean Fire. He wandered the planes for centuries before coming to the lands of Thylea. During his
travels, he despised the tyranny of Sydon and Lutheria,
and he decided that he would use the Promethean Fire
to change the world of Thylea for the better.
Phaeros sought out the greatest champion of each
race and brought them to the City of the Sirens, the
most beautiful city in Thylea. The sirens welcomed
Phaeros, for they had fallen out of favor with the Titans
and saw the angel as a messianic savior. Phaeros elevated
each champion to godhood, creating a new pantheon.
The sirens built great temples to each of the gods and
sent missionaries out into the rest of Thylea to bring
news of this new faith to the other races.
But the Twin Titans saw this and called upon their
father, Kentimane, to stop Phaeros. Sydon and Lutheria
saw Phaeros as a foreign invader who intended to
subvert everything that they had created. Kentimane
released the great beast, Scylla, from its imprisonment
on Typhon. Then Scylla and the Titans waged war
against the new gods. This battle raged on for weeks, but
finally, Phaeros was devoured by Scylla.
In the aftermath of the battle, Lutheria convinced the
remaining gods to return to their temples, where she
would offer them redemption-a chance to atone for
the sins of Phaeros. This was a trick-Lutheria used her
magic to trap the gods in their temples. Kentimane then
rose out of the ocean and destroyed the foundations of
the city, so that the oceans swallowed it.
Each of the new gods has remained trapped at the
bottom of the ocean for thousands of years. They know
that if they could convince someone to kill Scylla and
rescue Phaeros, they could return to the surface world
and rule over it again as gods.

Building the New Pantheon
If approached, the gods are all willing to speak with
the heroes. They explain that after being trapped for
so many millennia, they wish to leave the world of
Thylea and explore the many worlds that lie beyond.
They want to leave Thylea in capable hands, and they
feel that the heroes are the best candidates for that
responsibility.
Each of the gods will single out one of the heroes and
flatter them, extolling their virtues. Each god selects one
hero as a "worthy successor," and grant them gifts.
Quest: Destroying Scylla
The gods tell the heroes that they must destroy Scylla,
for she has swallowed the Promethean Fire. With the
fire released, the gods will be free, and they can use the
power of the Promethean Fire to grant a spark of divinity
to each of the heroes.
Roleplaying the Lost Pantheon
The empyreans are lying to the heroes-they are
entirely self-interested. They have had their minds
twisted by millennia of imprisonment. They want to
return to power over Thylea and punish the races that
left them trapped at the bottom of the ocean. They
have no intention of surrendering any portion of their
divinity.
Never Mention Phaeros. The gods are careful never
to speak of Phaeros. If the heroes mention the many
statues of the angel throughout the Sunken Kingdom,
they will claim that Phaeros was nothing more than a
mortal king of the siren people.

Entering the District


The Imprisoned Pantheon
Each of the gods is imprisoned in their own temple.
While they can move freely within their temples, they
cannot leave them, even if the walls are torn down. Each
of the gods is either a young empyrean or elder empyrean. While the gods can be destroyed, they will simply
reform in their temple in 1d6 days.
Over the millennia, the gods have convinced several
intelligent marine creatures to worship them, including the merfolk and nereid that live in the ruins of the
Sunken Kingdom. The gods want these worshippers to
free them from imprisonment by killing Scylla, but so far
none have been up to the task. These faithful creatures
are protective and jealous of their chosen god.



Scattered about this area are numerous statues of
various sizes. While several different entities are represented among them, the majority depict the same
figure: a tall, angelic being. He is commonly shown
brandishing a flaming sword, with his broad wings
outstretched.




There are many statues to Phaeros in this part of the
Sunken Kingdom. Some of the statues have his name
inscribed upon the base in Thylean script. There are
also statues to the other gods, but they are not as
numerous or as prominently displayed.

which the Sky Father expects the hero to kill Scylla.

D1. Temple of the Sky Father




The interior of this temple is decrepit and abandoned.
The walls are cracked, and the stone altars are broken.
In the middle of the floor is a toppled statue of a large
centaur. The entire place has been overrun by thick
seaweed; tall strands weave gently back and forth on
the ocean currents.



Shockingly, the inside of this temple is filled with a
large bubble of hot, oppressive air that repels seawater.
Hundreds of beautifully crafted weapons and suits of
armor are scattered about. In the center of the room is
a heavily muscled cyclops, working at a massive forge
that belches heat and smoke.



The Sky Father (LE elder empyrean) is one of the three
elder siblings who rule over the other gods. As a mortal,
he was a centaur. He now takes the form of a huge centaur with handsome features and a well-groomed beard.
He carries a beautiful silver lance and wears silver and
platinum jewelry. He is supremely arrogant to everyone
he speaks to, except for the one whom he chooses as his
"successor."
Ichthys Guardians. The front chambers of this
temple are ruined and covered in seaweed. Hidden
amongst the seaweed are three ichthys. These creatures
were merfolk heroes who led a band into the Chasm to
do battle against Scylla. When they failed, they returned
to beg forgiveness of the Sky Father. In a rage, he cursed
them to transform into ichthys. They are hateful creatures that attack everyone.
The Sky Father's Gift
The Sky Father chooses a strong warrior as his successor. He will bequeath upon this hero a powerful magical

D2. Forge of the Fire King



The Fire King (NE young empyrean) doesn't like
dealing with the aquatic races, and has used his power
to create a bubble of air so that they can't approach him.
He appears to be a massively-muscled cyclops with skin
that has been seared by countless years working at the
forge. He carries a massive hammer.
He is initially surprised if someone interrupts him
from his work. Once he recovers from his surprise, he
becomes inquisitive and wants to know everything that
the heroes can tell him about the surface world.
The Fire King's Gift
The Fire King chooses someone dressed in superior
armor to be his successor. He will allow that hero to
choose a single weapon or suit of armor in the temple.
Within 8 hours, he will transform the chosen item into
a +3 magical version that the hero must attune to equip.
He expects the hero to use this item to kill Scylla.



Curse of the Fire King. The enchantment on the
item is permanent, but if the hero doesn't kill Scylla
within one week, the item becomes cursed. While
under this curse, the hero refuses to relinquish the
item. The hero attuned to the item immediately goes
into a rage and attacks the closest creature. Once this
creature is reduced to 0 hit points, the attuned hero
switches to the next closest creature. In addition, the
attuned hero regenerates 1 hit point per round while
cursed, even if reduced to 0 hit points. The remove
curse spell must be cast three times on the item to end
the curse.

The Fish Queen (CE young empyrean) takes the
form of a 16-foot-tall mermaid. She is armored with
coral and wields a beautiful trident. A conch horn hangs
around her neck on a cord.

D3. Tomb of the Ghost Lord




There is an eerie sense of decay and disrepair in this
abandoned temple. The woven hangings on the wall
are frayed and torn, and the altars are eroded and
crumbling. Dark, oily waters swirl around like black
smoke, obscuring large parts of the temple from view.


The Fish Queen's Gift
The Fish Queen chooses the hero most closely associated with the sea. She announces her successor and then
blows on her conch horn to summon a giant shark.
The shark is completely white in color and has a harness
around its neck. The Fish Queen whispers to the shark
in Aquan and then tells her chosen hero that the shark
will serve as a loyal mount. The shark serves as a loyal
mount for seven days, after which point it will turn on
its rider and try to kill and consume them.

D5. Shrine of the Moon Maiden




The Lord of Ghosts (NE elder empyrean) hides within
the oily waters at the back of the temple. He giggles
occasionally. The Lord of Ghosts is the brother of the
Sky Father and the Sun Goddess. He takes the form of a
20-foot tall gygan. Despite his size, he is emaciated, and
his skin is parchment white. He is dressed in black robes
and carries a long spear.
The Mad God. As one of the three elder siblings, the
Lord of Ghosts used to rule over the other gods as part
of the trinity. However, the millennia of imprisonment
have driven him completely mad. He refuses to converse
with anyone and instead tries to kill anyone who enters
his temple. If the other gods are asked about the Lord of
Ghosts, they will warn the heroes to avoid him.

D4. Temple of the Fish Queen




This magnificent structure is made not from stone,
but from coral. The walls and ceiling are bone white
and emblazoned with the pattern of a million seashells. Instead of altars or statues, the interior is filled
with brightly colored branches of living coral, twisting
and intertwining in delicate shapes to form a wondrous garden.


The front chambers of the temple are occupied by a
sisterhood of six nereid called the Fish Speakers. These
fey creatures are fanatically loyal to the Fish Queen.
They want the honor of killing Scylla for their goddess,
but they know that they are not ready yet. They test all
visitors, refusing to allow anyone to see the Fish Queen
without first besting them in combat.





The view of this room is mostly obscured by thick
seaweed that has overrun the temple. Trapped in the
twisted strands are broken bits of furnishings and other
detritus. Floating above the tangled mess is a stunningly handsome young man.




The entrance hall of the temple is filled with seaweed and detritus that makes the entire area partially
obscured. There are six holes, 2 feet in diameter, along
each of the walls of the hallway, but they are difficult
to see. Noticing the holes requires a successful DC
20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Behind each hole is a
merrow, waiting until given a command to act. The
merrow have all fallen under the charms of an oceanid.
Taron (CE oceanid) greets anyone who enters the
temple. He serves the Moon Maiden and is also madly in
love with her. He fantasizes about becoming her consort
and is intensely jealous of any other male that tries to
seek an audience with her. If any male character seeks to
meet with the goddess, the oceanid will try to kill them.
In this case, he gives a signal to the merrow, who attack
from their concealed locations.
The Moon Maiden (NE young empyrean) has the
appearance of a towering, beautiful naiad nymph. She is
unconcerned about the actions of her murderous oceanid steward, as she is quite used to infatuated mortals
acting in such a manner.
The Moon Maiden's Gift
The Moon Maiden chooses the hero with the highest
Charisma score. She confers upon this hero the title of
Head Consort and grants them the boon of beauty. The
boon gives the recipient +4 to their Charisma score for
seven days, whereupon it becomes the curse of ugliness and reduces the recipient's Charisma score by 4
points. The curse can be removed with three casts of the
remove curse spell.

D6. Temple of the Great Hunter




The walls of this large, open chamber are covered with
art depicting scenes of savage battles and glorious
hunts. In the center of the room, a towering man sits
on a massive golden throne, glaring out angrily from his
perch. At the foot of the throne are three scowling and
battle-scarred storm giants.




The Great Hunter (CE young empyrean) appears as
a 20-foot-tall human man with long black hair. He sits
brooding on his throne in the central chamber of the
temple, fingering the blade of a giant sword.
Storm Giant Servants. Three storm giants serve
the Great Hunter. The storm giants don't worship the
empyrean, but they revere him as a great leader who
can return giant-kind to greatness. The giants are badly
scarred from a failed attempt to kill Scylla. Half of their
kin were killed when they descended to the bottom of
the Chasm and tried to kill the beast.
Testing the Champion. The Great Hunter is in no
mood to entertain guests who cannot prove themselves.
He orders the storm giants to attack the intruders, but
he will stop the fight before anyone can be killed. He will
declare whichever hero dealt the most damage to be his
champion and possible successor.
The Great Hunter's Gift
The Great Hunter grants a loyal companion to his
designated champion. It is a chuul that faithfully follows
the champion. The chuul will defend the champion in
battle, and it uses its magic sense to guide the champion
to magic items and magical traps. After seven days, the
chuul turns hostile and attacks its master.

D7. Tower of the Sun Goddess




The lower level of this thirty-story tower is marked by
murals and paintings that depict a beautiful woman,
engulfed by the aura of a blazing sun. A winding spiral
staircase extends upward, seemingly into infinity. From
somewhere high above, a blinding orb of golden light
shines down through the water.


The Sun Goddess (CE elder empyrean) is the unofficial head of the pantheon, though her two brothers
would dispute this claim. As a mortal, she was a siren
and therefore the most favored creation of Phaeros. She
appears as a 20-foot-tall siren with beautiful wings and
flowing golden hair.
The goddess meditates at the top of her 300 ft. tall
tower, surrounded by a bright nimbus of light. Anyone
approaching within 30 ft. of the Sun Goddess is blinded

Ch apter 11 - The New Pa ntheon



until they move away. The area 20 ft. from the Sun
Goddess is considered difficult terrain. Anyone that
moves through this light takes 35 (10d6) radiant damage
per 5 ft. moved. When someone touches the Sun
Goddess, her nimbus of light dims, and she identifies
the person who touched her as her chosen messiah.
The Sun Goddess's Gift
The Sun Goddess will give the sun crown to her messiah.
The sun crown manifests as a glowing halo that floats
above the head of the recipient. At any time, the wielder
of the sun crown can cast the daylight spell as a bonus
action, with the crown as the target. Once per short
rest, the wielder of the sun crown can cast the sunbeam
spell as a bonus action. The sun crown remains on the
head of the chosen messiah for seven days, whereupon
it explodes in a 10 ft. diameter ball of radiant energy that
causes 70 (20d6) radiant damage. The damage is halved
with a successful DC 20 Dexterity saving throw.

D8. Temple of the Vile Trickster




The walls of this temple are crumbling and broken, and
the roof has completely collapsed and fallen in. Broken
chunks of stone litter the ground. A few sickly tendrils
of decaying seaweed waft among the debris.




The Vile Trickster (CN young empyrean) looks like a
20 ft. tall satyr, though he prefers to remain invisible. He
uses his magic to play tricks on the heroes when they
first enter his temple. He uses dominate person and mass
suggestion to make the heroes perform embarrassing

The Sun Goddess

acts. He uses mislead and teleport to avoid the heroes
when attacked. He feigns death if he takes more than
100 hit points of damage.
Eventually, he surrenders to the heroes and tells them
a version of the truth, interspersed with nonsense:

• Sometimes gifts are terrible curses in disguise!
• The gods are going to conquer the world and punish

the mortal races for being so lazy!
• Eating twelve raw giant octopus eyeballs in one sitting
will grant immortality!
• Scylla has a bad case of indigestion, because she
devoured too many angels!

Of course there are stories of the Lost Pantheon, but
I never imagined that they could possibly be true.
For one thing, the songs were quite... suggestive.
Let's just say that the Trickster God of Satyrs got
up to some ripe old mischief and leave it at that.
- Kyrah, Goddess of Music

The Chasm
The Chasm is a massive fissure at the center of the
Sunken City. It stretches down for miles into an abyss
that eventually connects to the Nether Sea. The waters
of the Nether Sea are steeped in primordial magic and
have twisted the sea life here into creatures of immense
size and power. The most powerful and dangerous of
these creatures is Scylla. Scylla is an abomination. She
is the most dangerous creature ever spawned from the
island of Typhon. The Titans released her millennia
ago, to help defeat the angel Phaeros and his rogue
pantheon of gods. Now Phaeros is trapped in her stomach. She sleeps at the bottom of the Chasm, served by
an army of merrow who occasionally feed her sacrificial offerings.
The Chasm has three zones. Each of these zones has a
different environment than the other zones and is populated by its own unique set of creatures.

hateful tribe. The only creature that wouldn't immediately consider humanoid trespassers to be food is a
single dragon turtle that lairs in a cave.

The Upper Reaches

The deepest parts of the ocean are dangerous for many
reasons beyond predators. Light becomes a problem
once explorers have gone deep enough, but the most
difficult obstacle is the crushing weight of the ocean.
The impact of water pressure in the depths of the
ocean are ignored by creatures with a swim speed-or
those who are under the effects of escape spells like
freedom of movement. The water breathing spell helps
blunt some of the damage from water pressure. However,
a creature protected with freedom of movement or water
breathing takes a tremendous amount of damage if the
spells cease to function while in deep water.

Light still barely permeates the Upper Reaches of the
Chasm, which extends down for the first 1,000 feet.
This entire region is considered dim light. Standard
aquatic life can be found here, including a wide
variety of fish, octopus, and squid. These creatures
have learned to avoid the huge predators that hunt
in the region. Giant sharks are the apex predator of
the Upper Reaches. The sharks are descended from
the even more massive cetus that swim in the lower
regions of the Chasm.

The Void (1-mile depth)
Darkness is complete within the Void. The entire region
is considered dark, though darkvision still works. Eels
and squid are found in the inky depths, along with
strange fish that can generate light (such as anglerfish
and viperfish). This region is extremely dangerous, for
massive sea serpents and primordial cetus hunt in the
waters. The cursed ichthys crawl along the sides of the
chasm and have even banded together into a small and

The Pit (2-mile depth)
The very bottom of the Chasm is pitch black. However,
swirls of silvery water occasionally light up small
regions of the Pit. These are currents that have come
from the Nether Sea. The bottom of the Chasm is
littered with the decayed corpses of prey killed in the
regions above. Whale corpses are the most common,
but there are also dead ichthys, merfolk, and other
intelligent sea dwellers. The corpses provide food for
the only living creature in the Pit-the abomination
known as Scylla.

KEY LOCATIONS

All of the narration text assumes that the heroes have
some sort of light source or are using darkvision.

G1. The Upper Reaches




The faint glimmer of light from the surface dimly
illuminates these waters, which teem with aquatic life.
Multitudes of small and medium-sized fish dart back
and forth, gathering in brightly-colored schools. Larger
fish-sharks and other predators-prowl the waters,
endlessly searching for their next meal, as octopuses
and squid swim languidly by, their tentacles trailing
behind.


Gorathul will trade information to anyone who swears
an oath to end his husband's suffering. The ghost knows
the location of the wise turtle and the ichthys lair. If
someone is willing to allow the ghost to possess them,
he will travel with them and direct them to either lair.
He does not take control, but simply acts as another
voice in the head of his host.

G3. The Void




The Upper Reaches are the domain of giant sharks.
Anyone swimming in the Upper Reaches has a chance
of becoming hunted by a giant shark. The chance
is 25% when someone first enters the region, with a
cumulative 10% chance for every 10 minutes spent
there. A giant shark will attack from below, with advantage on its first attack. If the giant shark draws blood,
there is a 20% chance per round that the blood will
summon an additional 1d4 giant sharks.

G2. The Last Plateau




A massive formation of jagged rock juts out from one
wall of the Chasm, forming a flat, protruding ledge that
overlooks the inky depths of the Void beneath. Small
fishes, eels, and crustaceans weave their way among
the beautiful coral structures that cover the rocky outcropping, protected from the currents and the deadly
predators looming in the darkness below.




As the light from the surface fades, the water becomes
cold and black. As you descend deeper and deeper, the
teeming aquatic life of the Upper Reaches gradually
gives way to a vast, dark emptiness. Few creatures can
survive in these depths, and those that do are fierce
and deadly.




The Void is the hunting grounds for two of the deadliest
predators in the ocean-the cetus and the sea serpent.
The chance of becoming prey for one of these creatures is 25% when someone first enters the region, with
a cumulative 10% chance for every 10 minutes spent
there. There is a 1 in 4 chance that the predator is a sea
serpent-otherwise it is a cetus.
The cetus will attack from below like a giant shark. If
the cetus draws blood, there is a 25% chance per round
that the blood will summon an additional 2d4 giant
sharks. The sea serpent hunts alone and no other predator dares come between the serpent and its prey.
Walls of the Void. Swimming close to the chasm walls
is a little safer than swimming out in the open. However,
there is a non-cumulative 10% chance every 10 minutes
of encountering 1d4 ichthys. The cursed monstrosities
attack trespassers on sight.

G4. The Ichthys Lair



The Last Plateau is so called because it is the last place
someone can rest before descending into the darkness
of the Void. The coral is home to many fish, eels, and
octopi. It is also haunted by the ghost of a merman
named Gorathul.
Ghost of Gorathul. Gorathul makes himself known
by possessing fish and octopi and using them to lure
explorers to the skeletal remains of his body. He communicates with anyone who comes within 20 ft. of his
body. He died decades ago, trying to fulfill a promise to
his husband. His husband was cursed by Lutheria and
began the painful transformation into an ichthys. He
made Gorathul promise to kill him, but when the time
came, he couldn't make himself to do it. Later, when his
husband had been lost completely to the transformation,
Gorthul followed him into the Chasm to try and fulfill
his promise-but he didn't get very far.
288

Ch apter 11 - The New Pa ntheon



Through the murky waters it is just possible to make
out the medium-sized entrance of a cave carved into
the side of the chasm. The cramped entrance gives way
to an enormous chamber littered with the stark white
skulls of numerous sharks and whales, along with the
skeletal remains of several humanoids, all picked clean
by ocean scavengers.




A dozen ichthys have built a small community within a
cave. The cave opening is 10 ft. wide (small enough so
that cetus and sea serpents cannot enter) and opens up
into a large chamber 150 ft. in diameter.
Two ichthys always stand guard at the entrance. The
other ichthys sleep in clutches of two or three in the
chamber. One of the ichthys sleeping in the cave is the
husband of the ghost named Gorathul. All of the ichthys
appear to be in constant agonizing pain.

objects. In addition to the gems and magic items, 55,000
sp and 21,000 gp have been collected into a large pile.

G7. Shark Nest


On a large, sandy ledge extending out from the chasm
wall you see several dozen terrifying figures. Dead-eyed
giant sharks cluster together, motionless and asleep.
Amongst them are also a handful of terrifying sharks
the size of whales. Fortunately, all of the sharks are
currently resting; peaceful and unaware.

G5. The Serpent Holes




Several large, cylindrical holes have been burrowed into
the chasm wall in a seemingly random pattern. The
perfectly smooth tunnels are twenty feet in diameter,
and they extend so far and deep into the bedrock that
their terminus cannot be seen.






Each of these holes in the sleeping place for a massive
sea serpent. The sea serpents excavate tunnels that
extend for thousands of feet, terminating in round
chambers where they rest. There is a 1 in 4 chance that
an intruder will find a sea serpent in its lair. There is also
a 1 in 4 chance that an intruder will be met by a returning sea serpent while leaving the tunnel.

G8. The Pit




A solitary dragon turtle lairs in this cave. The dragon
turtle is one of the oldest of its kind, and its shell shows
damage from dozens of encounters with cetus and sea
serpents. It mostly stays within its cave, only venturing
forth to eat. Over the centuries it has gathered a vast
hoard, which it guards jealously.
Mercenary Dragon. The dragon turtle is greedy for
treasure, just like all of its draconic kin. It is willing to
help explorers for the right price. For 10,000 gp, the
dragon turtle will join the party and aid them in battle.
The dragon turtle knows all of the locations within
the Chasm. If reduced to half hit points in a fight, the
dragon turtle will flee and return to its lair.



The long descent into the chasm has finally reached
its end. The sandy, black bottom of the ocean is littered
with the rotting corpses of gargantuan whales: leviathans of the deep, brought down by some monstrous
apex predator. A smattering of half-eaten humanoid
corpses also dot the ocean floor-evidence that whatever
horror dwells here will feed on anything.



A wide, flat ledge protrudes out from the chasm wall,
leading to a massive cave. The fifty-foot-wide, thirtyfoot-high entrance to the cavern is guarded by dozens
of large stalactites and stalagmites, giving the vague
impression of a gaping, tooth-filled maw.



There are a half-dozen cetus and two dozen giant
sharks that sleep on the ledge. Waking these creatures is
almost certainly suicide.

G6. The Wise Turtle








Nothing is alive in the Pit except for Scylla. Every 10
minutes that the party spends in the Pit has a 20%
chance of drawing the attention of Scylla.


G9. Scylla




The cold, dark waters around you shudder. The silence
of the depths is broken by a deep, resonant moan:
the cry of an entity both ancient and horrifying. From
the gloom, a gargantuan abomination emerges: six
serpent-like heads twist and writhe on long necks protruding from a grotesquely bloated torso. The undersea
nightmare lurches toward you with terrifying speed,
writhing across the ocean floor on twelve monstrous
black tentacles, gnashing its hungry jaws.


Scylla is ravenous and will try to eat anything that it
comes across in its domain. Scylla is fearless and will
fight to the death. Anything that Scylla swallows is
subjected to a magical stasis that paralyzes its victims



for the process of digestion, which can take thousands
of years. When Scylla is killed, the angel Phaeros will be
released from this magical stasis. The solar will cut his
way out of Scylla's gut and appear before the heroes.




As the horror of the deep finally collapses, its bloated
torso suddenly begins to pulse and throb. A thick
tearing sound ripples through the waters, and a deep
gash appears in its abdomen. The tip of a glowing blade
emerges from inside the beast's belly as someone-or
something-carves its way to freedom.
Seconds later, the fresh wound rips wide open, and a
magnificent winged humanoid crawls out of the monster's stomach. In his right hand he clutches a mighty
sword, while his left hand holds a ball of blue fire that
blazes even at the bottom of the ocean.
In a voice that booms through the depths, he
announces: "The glory of the gods be upon you, brave
mortals. By slaying the demonic Scylla, you have freed
me to complete my sacred task and restore to power
the rightful pantheon of Thylea!"
Ignoring any further attempts to engage him in conversation, the angel flaps his mighty wings and shoots
upwards, vanishing as he speeds toward the surface.


FREEING THE GODS

Once Phaeros has used the Promethean Fire to free the
empyreans, he will return to deal with the heroes. He
has learned that they seek the three Divine Artifacts,
and wants to destroy the party so that they cannot challenge his pantheon's right to rule Thylea.
Although they have been freed, the empyreans don't
come to Phaeros's aid, because they resent their long
years of imprisonment. They secretly hope that the
party will kill the solar so that they don't have to.


You hear a faint thrumming in the distance. It grows
steadily louder, until it becomes the deafening roar
of thunder. A powerful wave rolls across you, nearly
knocking you off your feet, and a bright flash illuminates the ocean depths.
"Traitors! Blasphemers! Infidels!"
These words of judgment ring out from all around
you in an echoing chorus of voices.
Suddenly the angel appears, floating high above
you. His eyes burn with rage. His face twists into a
mask of hatred as he raises his sword high.
He throws back his head and unleashes a mighty
scream. The ground beneath you shakes as the
ocean itself trembles before the fury of an immortal.
Then he plunges towards you, his blade raised to
strike you down.



Phaeros is able to swim using his fly speed. He will fly as
quickly as possible to the Temple District of the Sunken
Kingdom and ignore any attacks directed at him. He
plans to use the Promethean Fire to free the empyreans
from their temple prisons. Refer to Freeing the Gods.

G10. Nether Sea Fissure




A deep, narrow fissure slices its way across the ocean
floor. Shimmering silver water seeps from the rift,
gently floating upwards until it slowly disperses in the
darkness of the ocean depths.


Anyone trying to swim more than 200 ft. into this rift
will come under the magical influence of the Nether
Sea's primordial waters. Refer to the Nether Sea chapter
for details about this strange liquid.
Treasure
Fifty feet into the rift, there is a great treasure contained
within a giant-sized adamantine chest. The chest is
locked, and it requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity
check using thieves' tools to open. Roll on the Treasure
Hoard table for Challenge rating 17+ in the 5th Edition

there is a 25% chance that a current of silvery water
from the Nether Sea will wash through.









Whoever deals the deathblow to Phaeros will inherit
the Promethean Fire. At this point, the empyreans from
the Temple District will appear before the heroes.

The Lost Pantheon Restored
The lost gods claim that Phaeros must have gone insane
after thousands of years trapped in the belly of Scylla.
They allow the heroes to keep any divine gifts that they
bestowed upon them. They claim that they will now
leave Thylea forever. However, this is a lie. They intend
to gather their strength and return to rule over all of
Thylea. Refer to the Apokalypsis chapter for details.

ne of Thylea's godlike beings has
hatched a plan that will bring ruin to
everything that the heroes have fought and
suffered for. The primordial monsters that
have remained imprisoned in the Nether Sea since the
dawn of time will be unleashed upon the world. These
creatures will annihilate Thylea's greatest cities. Unless
the heroes figure out how to stop these titanic engines of
destruction, the world will come to an apocalyptic end.
This adventure should serve as an explosive finale to
your campaign. By the end of the Apokalypsis, the heroes
will be 20th level and will have most likely achieved the
prerequisites to becoming gods. This chapter works best
if the heroes have completed the adventure described in
the Sunken Kingdom chapter, but it's not required. In any

Ch apter 12 - Apok aly psis

MAKING PREPARATIONS
Villains of the Apokalypsis
This series of events is set in motion by several villains
who may be acting independently or in concert.
Lutheria, Mistress of Death
Even if the heroes killed Lutheria, the Mistress of Death
can be one of the villains of this chapter. She had a pact
with powerful daemonic masters on the plane of Hades.
After spending years as a pitiful larva, she fulfilled her
end of the bargain, and the overlords of Hades sent
Lutheria back to the mortal world. Now, she lurks in the
shadows of her abandoned temples, weakened but filled
with a sense of renewed purpose.
Seeing what has happened to Thylea in her absence
has infuriated Lutheria beyond measure. The mortals who defeated her are celebrated as the new
Dragonlords, while she and her husband have been
forgotten. Lutheria feels that this 'bold new world' is
a joke. Accordingly, she has prepared a much funnier
and crueler joke: the total eradication of every living
thing in Thylea. She will accomplish this by unleashing
the Weapons of the Gods from the Nether Sea upon the
surface world.

The Forgotten Pantheon
Deep within the Sunken Kingdom, the lost pantheon of
empyreans created by the angel, Phaeros, have waited
for thousands of years for their chance to rule Thylea.
Now it seems that their time has finally arrived. If they
have not already been released from their temples by the
heroes, then Lutheria releases them now.
Lutheria has laid events in motion that will allow the
Empyreans to ascend to godhood. She is a shadow of
her former self-no longer strong enough to battle the
heroes on her own. The best that she can do is unleash
the Nether Titans upon the world, giving the Empyreans
an opportunity to take vengeance on her behalf.
Once the Dragonlords are weakened by their battles
against the Titans, the Empyreans plan to destroy the
heroes and take credit for saving the people of Thylea
from the Apokalypsis. Then, the Empyreans can transform themselves into true gods using the three Divine
Artifacts that the heroes have so helpfully recovered: the
Caduceus, the Ambrosia, and the Promethean Fire.
Other Possible Villains
The Apokalypsis does not need to be a scheme hatched
by Lutheria if that doesn't fit the needs of your campaign.
You can replace her with someone else, though this villain
works best if it has a strong personal connection to the
heroes. Here are some suggestions:

• Sydon. Perhaps it is Sydon who has returned from the
dead. He is motivated by vengeance.

• The Kraken. The Kraken of the Forgotten Sea has long

wished to dominate Thylea. With Sydon and Lutheria
defeated, it sees an opportunity for the schemes it has
put into place to finally come to fruition.
• One of the Heroes. This works if one of your players has
retired their hero character. One of the more ambitious
heroes might betray their friends in a mad quest to
become Thylea's one true god.

Making the Heroes Care
The Apokalypsis works best when the heroes have a
lot invested in the fate of Thylea. This investment can
be accomplished through game sessions with a focus
on roleplaying. Alternatively, a game master can have
the campaign skip forward by another year or two and
describe how the world has changed and the heroes
have prospered. If the heroes have new cities named
after them, then those cities should have grown significantly. If the heroes are the leaders of a new Dragonlord
order, then they should be widely revered as the new
peacekeepers of Thylea. If they are kings or queens, then
perhaps they have children now.
If the heroes have recovered the Divine Artifacts, then
they may already be on the path toward immortality.
Many of the prerequisites to godhood described in the
Divine Path appendix can be accomplished over the
course of this final, epic adventure.

PRELUDE TO THE
APOKALYPSIS

The story begins with the heroes facing down one of the
last threats to peace in the lands of Thylea. It is an army
that has been rampaging across the countryside, raiding
towns, and destroying merchant caravans. The army
should be led by an old enemy of the heroes. However,
the Order of Sydon is assumed to be the antagonist in
the scenario below.




You stand at the head of your army, gazing across
the battlefield at the ranks of your enemy. Under the
Order of Sydon, the remnants of the Titan armies have
banded together one last time to lay waste to the
realm. Centaurs, minotaurs, gygans, and cyclopes have
joined forces with vengeful human soldiers to destroy
everything that you have spent years building. But you
are the Dragonlords-the sovereign peacekeepers of
Thylea-and to challenge you means certain death.




The Order of Sydon has assembled an army that
includes several thousand soldiers, centaurs, and
minotaurs, along with dozens of cyclopes and gygans.
They have banded together to return the world to the
way it was before the heroes overthrew the Titans. The
leader of the army might be a resurrected Gaius. If not,
feel free to replace him with another villain that survived the campaign. Alternatively, you can use Gaius's
statistics to create a new leader of the Order of Sydon.

The Last Battle
The heroes have an army consisting of hundreds of loyal
soldiers and captains. The heroes are likely mounted
on young dragons, and they are equipped with many
powerful magic items. The are capable of unleashing
terrifying destructive might with high level spells.
Despite their vast numbers, the remnant armies do not
stand much of a chance.
The battle can be played out with the heroes attacking
the center of the enemy army. The center of the enemy
army consists of 50 soldiers, 5 captains, 10 centaurs, 6
minotaurs, and 6 gygans. Once the heroes have killed
or incapacitated half of them, the enemy's morale will
break and they will rout, causing the rest of the enemy
army to break and run.
The Might of the Dragonlords
The purpose of this battle is twofold. First, it is meant to
make the heroes feel powerful. Despite the large number
of soldiers arrayed against them, the heroes should be
able to deal with them quite easily. Second, the battle
shows that the heroes are the masters of Thylea. They
are the continent's most powerful heroes and protectors.
It is their responsibility to keep the peace.

Celebration of the Last Battle
With the defeat of the Order of Sydon, there is much
rejoicing. Peace has finally come to Thylea. The commanders in the heroes' army suggest that a celebration
should be held. Wine is brought in for the soldiers.
Songs and elaborate plays are performed that describe
the exploits of the now legendary heroes.
Once the celebrations begin to wind down, the heroes
receive an urgent message that they must return to
Mytros as soon as possible.

Challenging High Level Adventurers
When players reach high levels, the style of play changes
significantly. High level adventures aren't about dungeon
crawling. It is difficult for a dungeon crawl to be challenging when heroes have access to divination magic that can
map out an entire dungeon and teleportation magic that
allows them to travel directly to the final boss or treasure.
In addition, at high levels the heroes should be among
the wisest and most powerful people in the realms. There
is no one to tell them what to do. The challenge is that
they must figure everything out on their own.

EMERGENCE OF THE
NETHER TITANS

The heroes have received a summons to return to
Mytros. When they arrive they learn that a much greater
threat has emerged to threaten Thylea. The Oracle,
Versi, has descended into despair and has demanded to
speak with the heroes.




As you make your way through the palace, none of the
people you pass can meet your eye. They stare at the
floor, enveloped in a cloud of hopelessness and despair.
As you near the Oracle's chamber, you hear Versi
give an anguished wail. Rushing in, you find her laying
on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Seeing you, she
reaches out a trembling hand and crawls towards you.
"I have witnessed the end of Thylea. Visions of blood
and darkness. Death. Utter destruction. The Weapons
of the Gods are free - the Apokalypsis has come!"


Versi reveals that the Weapons of the Gods have been
released from their prisons in the Nether Sea (N6). These
massive Nether Titans will destroy the world if they are
not stopped... but Versi has already abandoned all hope.
This is the end of all things-the Doom of Thylea. The
nightmarish vision from her original prophecy has finally
come to pass, in spite of everything.
The heroes learn from their advisors that refugees
have begun to stream into Mytros. These refugees speak
of massive Titans laying waste to the outlying settlements. There seem to be four different Titans:
that this is the legendary Kraken.

• A mindless, gargantuan beast the size of a castle that
devours everything in its path.

• A nightmarish dragon with breath of molten fire and
massive wings that blot out the sun.

• A malevolent behemoth that levels mountains with
terrifying beams of primordial lightning.

The heroes must decide how to stop these world
ending threats. None but the Dragonlords have the
power to stand against such creatures, which have been
locked away since the dawn of time.

The Apokalypsis is a series of scenarios that must be
overcome in order to stop untold devastation from
being wrought upon Thylea. Each scenario presents a
straightforward win condition for the heroes: destroy
one of the Nether Titans as it attacks a city. The heroes
must use their ample resources and magical power to
gather information on how to accomplish this.
Adjusting the Difficulty



CANCELLING THE
APOKALYPSIS

It is important to note that the capabilities of heroes will
vary drastically depending upon experience and party
composition. A group of four relatively inexperienced
players will find the scenarios below incredibly challenging. You might want to explain the tactical weaknesses of
each Nether Titan to your party. In this case, encourage
your party to commune with the gods for advice.
Additionally, you should encourage the party to go after
the magical artifacts. On the other hand, a group of six
experienced players with optimized heroes will be able to
defeat any single monster with little chance of defeat;
even the dreaded tarrasque. For knowledgeable groups, we
recommend that you provide less guidance. You might also
want to exclude the artifacts and bolster the Nether Titans
with the reinforcements suggested for each.

The Four Nether Titans
Massive Titans have emerged from the Nether Sea and
are rampaging across Thylea, leaving destruction and
death in their wake. The heroes must choose which of
the threats to deal with first. This might be a difficult
choice, because the cities that don't receive aid quickly
will almost certainly be utterly destroyed. The four
threats that ravage Thylea are:

• The Tarrasque
• The Kraken
• The Nether Dragon
• The Behemoth
Ch apter 12 - Apok aly psis

295

Endangered Cities
The creatures target the most populated cities in Thylea:

• The City of Mytros
• The City of Aresia
• The City of Estoria
• Cities founded by the heroes
You are encouraged to have the Titans target cities that
mean the most to the heroes. The order in which the
cities are saved from the Nether Titans determines how
badly the citizens suffer.
1. First city saved: This city is untouched.
2. Second city saved: The walls of this city are shattered and hundreds of soldiers killed, but otherwise
the people are mostly spared.
3. Third city saved: The city walls are breached. Most
of the soldiers are killed and a quarter of the population is killed. More than half of the buildings in the
city are reduced to ruins.
4. Fourth city saved: The city is entirely reduced to
smoldering ruin. No one survives.
If the heroes are able to come up with a plan where
they split their group into two and defeat two Nether
Titans at the same time, then they should be rewarded
for their ingenuity. All four cities can be saved in this
manner with minimal loss of life.

Using Spells to Prepare
Spells can be more effective at gathering relevant information. These include:

• Arcane eye, clairvoyance, scrying. Can be used to

spy on the Titan before attacking it. This allows the
heroes to see what powers the titan can use.
• Divination, contact other plane, commune. Allows
heroes to get advice on how to defeat the Titans. This
includes a titan's weaknesses, notable attributes and
any useful religious magical artifacts.
• Locate creature. Allows heroes to pinpoint exactly
where the Titan is located.
• Legend lore. Reveals useful magical artifacts that can
be used against the Titan. Also provides information
on some of the Titan's notable attributes.
• Find the path. Reveals the exact location of useful
magical artifacts.

THE TARRASQUE

The tarrasque is a mindless engine of destruction. The
heroes will discover it laying waste to its chosen city, one
block at a time.


Planning to defeat the Titans
The heroes must use all of their powers and skills to
defeat the Titans. Just rushing in and battling each
creature will likely result in the death of the heroes
and the destruction of Thylea. The heroes should use
their magic, their skills, and their connections to learn
everything they can about each of the Titans.
Using Skills to Prepare
• Arcana. Allows the heroes to discover magical lore
that is pertinent to defeating a Titan. This includes
useful spells that could be used to defeat it.
• History. Allows the heroes to discover historical lore
that is pertinent to defeating a Titan. This includes
learning about the titan's history which might include
clues to its weaknesses.
• Investigation. The party can search the libraries of
Aresia, Mytros, or Estoria to learn about a Titan's significant weaknesses or religious magical artifacts.
• Nature. The party can call upon druids to determine
some of a Titan's notable attributes.
• Religion. Allows heroes to discover religious lore
that is pertinent to defeating a Titan. This includes
information on religious magical artifacts that might
be useful in defeating the Titan.

296

Ch apter 12 - Apok aly psis



An enormous armor-plated lizard-the tarrasque-is
literally devouring the city. The unfathomable size
of the massive beast boggles the mind. Its shadow
cloaks entire neighborhoods of the city in darkness as
it rampages. Its enormous claws tear down buildings
with ease, and its gaping, hooked jaws swallow entire
families whole with each bite.
The screams of the terrified people in its path are
drowned out by the great bellows of the beast and the
thunder of its echoing footfalls as it levels the city in an
unbridled feeding frenzy.


Defeating the Tarrasque
Weaknesses
• It is an earthbound creature and cannot fly or use any
kind of ranged attack.
Notable Attributes
• It perceives creatures without the need for eyesight.
• Its carapace can reflect magical attacks back upon a
spell caster.
Immunities
• It is immune to fear, and its mind cannot be influenced by magic.
• It is immune to fire and poison damage.
Useful Religious Artifact
• The famed wizard Damon studied the legendary
Nether Titans for decades. His tome of research
includes a spell scroll for reverse gravity and maze.



Location of Artifact
• Damon's Tome is located in the Tomb of Isadore at the
Necropolis of Telamok. The heroes may find themselves fighting a lich if they aren't careful.
Useful Spells
• The maze spell can trap the Titan for a limited time. The
reverse gravity spell can temporarily incapacitate it.

Reinforcements
It may happen that the tarrasque is too easy of a foe for
a well-prepared group of heroes, especially if many of
those heroes are mounted on dragons. In this case, consider adding a surprise in the midst of the battle.


THE KRAKEN

The Kraken can attack any of the cities of Thylea. It can
swim up rivers and crawl across the ground to reach
cities that are far from the coast. Of the four Nether
Titans, the Kraken is the only one that was not freed
from the Nether Sea, as it had already freed itself centuries ago. It saw this opportunity to devastate Thylea and
seized it. The Kraken is the most intelligent of the Titans
and will not throw its life away if at all possible.




A cacophony of screeches and screams rains down from
the sky. Looking up you see a swarm of chimera burst
from the cover of the clouds and plunge towards you: a
terrifying flock of scavengers following in the tarrasque's
wake, feeding on the scraps it leaves behind.


The chimera (one per hero) have followed the tarrasque, feeding on the carcasses that it leaves in its
wake. They have come to defend the Titan, which they
have come to worship as a food-giving god.



A wall of water rises up from the ocean and crashes
into the city's port, sweeping away the ships and sailors
unlucky enough to be caught in its path. Seconds later,
a massive tentacle emerges from the water and lashes
out to pluck a screaming victim from the street. His
cries are cut short as the writhing appendage instantly
crushes him to pulp.
A dozen more flailing tentacles appear from the
water, snatching up helpless victims and dragging them
into the depths. Another massive wave smashes onto
the shore as the Kraken raises its enormous body from
the sea. It tilts back its head and opens its giant maw
to let loose a deafening, bloodthirsty scream.

Defeating the Kraken
Weaknesses
• The most intelligent of the Nether Titans is also
the one most susceptible to attacks on its mind: the
Kraken is not immune to charm magic.

THE NETHER DRAGON

The Nether Dragon is a dragon with iridescent black
scales that breathes fire. It is an ancient red dragon
with the shadow dragon template. The Nether Dragon
only comes out to attack during the night.


Notable Attributes
• It can see through any illusion.
• It can call down a lightning storm upon its victims.

Thunder echoes down from the night sky, and dark
clouds roll in to cover the moon. A strong wind whips
across the rooftops, cold and biting. Suddenly a
shadow drops out of the sky; in the torchlight it is just
possible to make out a winged monstrosity with a long,
reptilian neck swooping down.
The dragon roars, then opens its jaws and unleashes
a blast of fire upon the buildings. The dark night
explodes with bright orange flames. Wood, stone and
metal are instantly consumed; anyone caught in the
inferno is incinerated before they can even scream.
Shouts and shrieks rise up from every quarter of the
city as the fire quickly spreads. People panic and run
for cover as the dragon wheels around then dives in for
another aerial assault...

Immunities
• It is immune to fear.
• Lightning does not harm it at all.
Useful Religious Artifact
• A talisman of pure good was forged by the god Volkan
during the First War. It would be a powerful item to
use against the Kraken.
Location of Artifact
• The last Dragonlord to possess the talisman was an
oathbreaker. His body, and the talisman, can be found
on the Island of the Oathbreakers in the Nether Sea.
The erinyes won't allow the heroes to take it without
a fight.
Useful Spells
• The symbol of hopelessness spell can trigger despair in
the powerful mind of the Kraken.

Reinforcements
The Kraken has not come alone. With it are two
nycaloth and twelve mezzoloth. These creatures will
come to the Kraken's aid a few rounds into the battle.
Increasing the Challenge
In order to make Thylea's kraken a more challenging
encounter, consider giving it this ability:
Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the Kraken fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

We have long known about the Kraken, and we've had
rumors of the Tarrasque, but these other creatures are
entirely unknown to us. The Nether Dragon seems to
be some demon out of Hades, whereas the Behemoth
can only have been created from the primordial chaos
at the dawn of time.

• The symbol of insanity spell can prevent it from taking
actions.

Reinforcements
If you want to make this battle more difficult, the Nether
Dragon can be leading a dragon flight that includes four
young black dragons and two young red dragons.

THE BEHEMOTH

Villains with High Level Spells

The Behemoth is perhaps the most dangerous of the
Nether Titans. It threatens the City of Mytros.


It is good to remember that high level villains often have
the same or even more powerful magic than the heroes
do. A villain might be able to use legend lore to determine
the weaknesses of the heroes, then scrying to find out
where they are and finally teleport to attack with surprise.



Even the largest buildings are dwarfed by the massive beast laying waste to the helpless city. Part
dragon, part giant-yet much larger than either-the
Behemoth smashes homes under its claws and obliterates entire city blocks with its tail. Most terrifying of
all, however, is when it opens its enormous mouth and
unleashes a blast of primordial energy that instantly
disintegrates any material it touches.
Anyone caught in the monster's path is doomed,
with scores of lives snuffed out instantly. Those caught
in its path turn and run screaming in terror, or stand
slack-jawed and motionless, their minds broken from
the horror of what they have witnessed.
Entire districts are already in ruins; nothing
remains but rubble and corpses. And it won't be long
before the insatiable Behemoth reduces the entire
city to dust.


Strike 1: Daemonic Horde
When the heroes defeat the first of the Nether Titans,
Lutheria will send her daemonic allies to attack them.
While this will hint to the heroes that someone is
behind the release of the Nether Titans, Lutheria can't
help herself; she wants to taunt the heroes.
An ultroloth and arcanaloth will lead a strike force
that includes one nycaloth and one mezzoloth for
each hero. The arcanaloth will use divination magic to
discover the location of the heroes and then use teleport
to appear right in the midst of the party.




Defeating the Behemoth
Weaknesses
• The Behemoth is vulnerable to all types of damage.
Notable Attributes
• The Behemoth can breathe energy across great distances.
Immunities
• It is immune to fear and its mind cannot be influenced
by magic.
Useful Religious Artifact
• The famed wizard Damon studied the legendary
Nether Titans for decades. His tome of research
includes a spell scroll for reverse gravity and maze.
Location of Artifact
• Damon's tome is located in the Tomb of Isadore at the
Necropolis of Telamok. The heroes may find themselves fighting a lich if they aren't careful.
Useful Spells
• A maze spell can easily trap the Titan for a limited time.

THE VILLAINS STRIKE!

As the heroes are actively trying to solve these
world-shattering threats, the villains will strike out
against them, forcing them to react. These attacks show
the heroes that there is a power responsible for unleashing the Nether Titans upon the world.



There is a sudden burst of noise; the wretched sound
of reality itself being ripped apart. The awful sound
is followed by a burst of darkness that momentarily
envelops everything around you.
When the darkness disperses an instant later, you
find a horde of demonic creatures standing before you:
man-sized beetles standing on their hind legs; brutish
winged trolls with long, deadly horns; a green-skinned
humanoid with a smooth, amphibian-like skull; and
what appears to be a human with a jackal's head.
The jackal-headed demon steps forward, grinning so
you can see its fangs. "My master is impressed. She did
not think mere mortals could defeat any of the Nether
Titans. It seems she has underestimated you... though I
did warn her this could happen."




The yugoloth will all fight to the death.

Strike 2: Lutheria
When the heroes defeat the second Nether Titan,
Lutheria decides that she must make an appearance so
that the heroes know that she is responsible for their
woes. She summons one of the naiad of the Oldwoods
and has her use her divination magic to show Lutheria
exactly where the heroes are located and what they are
doing. She gathers a band of her servants, including
twelve maenad and twelve goatlings. Lutheria uses her
animal shapes spell to transform her servants into giant
scorpions. They approach the heroes at night using
stealth (augmented by pass without trace).





From the shadows you hear a loud series of sharp clicks
and hisses. Seconds later, dozens of giant scorpions
crawl into view... followed by the Mistress of Death.
A cruel smile creeps across Lutheria's lips as she casts
her gaze upon you. "You tried to kill death itself. But
I am eternal. Like the darkness of night, I shall always
return. Now, I am stronger than ever... and you must
pay for your transgressions!"




Lutheria's servants fight to the death, but she herself
teleports away to safety once she's reduced to half of her
hit points. You may also choose to have her resurrect
Chondrus as an undead mage to join the battle.

Strike 3: The Empyreans
When the heroes defeat the third Nether Titan, Lutheria
convinces the Empyreans that it is time for them to
make their move. The Empyreans send three of their
number to wipe out the heroes: the Sky Father, the
Great Hunter, and the Moon Maiden. You may choose
others instead of these three, but the Sky Father and the
Sun Goddess should survive.



A bright light suddenly appears in the sky, and three
divine figures slowly descend from above: the Great
Hunter, the Moon Maiden, and the Sky Father.
The three Empyreans settle on the ground, towering
over you. The Sky Father steps forward, while the other
two stand behind him. You notice they seem tense;
poised and ready as if expecting trouble.
"Brave heroes of Thylea, you have defeated the
Nether Titans. Truly we chose our champions well."
The Sky Father tilts his head in your direction in a
subtle nod of gratitude and acknowledgement. But a
second later his demeanor takes a sudden, dark turn...
"Your part in the story is now done. With the Nether
Titans defeated, it is time for us to claim our place as
the New Pantheon of Thylea... and time for you to
become martyrs to our glorious cause!"




If possible, the Empyreans will trigger any divine gifts
that they gave to the heroes, transforming them into the
cursed versions. The Empyreans fight until one of them
falls in battle. At this point, they will retreat to rejoin the
rest of the pantheon in The Empyrean Palace.

The Final Confrontation
Once the Nether Titans have been defeated, the heroes
must move against the villains who orchestrated the
Apokalypsis. They can move against the villains earlier
if they want to, but this might cause their cities to suffer
additional destruction.
The heroes can use divination magic to learn who is
behind the Apokalypsis and where they are located. They
will discover that Lutheria and the Empyreans have constructed a new palace on the tallest mountain in Thylea.
They can also use divination spells to gather information on the strengths and weaknesses of their enemies.
Using the spell legend lore reveals the names and religious
domains of each of the Empyreans. This can also be accomplished with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Religion) check.

Defeating the Empyreans
Weaknesses
• Charm magic is effective.
Notable Attributes
• Empyreans can see through all illusions.
Immunities
• Empyreans can only be damaged with magical weapons.
Useful Spells
• A feeblemind spell can shatter even the powerful mind
of an Empyrean.

THE EMPYREAN PALACE

The palace is constructed from marble and granite,
and it has been decorated with countless statues of the
Empyreans. The statues are painted so that they are
remarkably lifelike in appearance.

General Features
All of the ceilings in the palace are 30 ft. in height. The
massive double doors are forged from adamantine and
are each 10 ft. wide and 25 ft. high.
The palace has been protected with powerful spells.
All of the spells have been cast at 9th level, and they
require a DC 19 dispel magic to negate. The spells
include the following:

• Private Sanctum makes the interior of the lair itself

immune to divination of any sort. It also makes it
impossible for creatures to teleport in or out.
• Forbiddance protects against teleportation, ethereal
or astral creatures, and celestials, elementals, fey,
fiends, and undead.
• Symbol has been used to create traps throughout the
palace. All of the symbol spells will trigger if someone other than an empyrean, Lutheria, or the Kraken
approaches within 10 feet of it. The saving throw for
the symbol spells is DC 23.

Inhabitants
All of the surviving Empyreans are at the palace.

• The Sun Goddess (elder empyrean)
• The Sky King (elder empyrean)
• The Lord of Ghosts (elder empyrean)
• The Great Hunter (young empyrean)
• The Moon Maiden (young empyrean)
• The Fire King (young empyrean)
• The Fish Queen (young empyrean)
• The Vile Trickster (young empyrean)
Mistress of Death. Lutheria wanders the depths of the
palace, cackling to herself. The Empyreans avoid her, for
even though she has been a useful ally, they still remember how she tricked them millennia ago.
The Kraken. If the Kraken survived its battle with
the heroes, then it might also be at the palace. Its alien
nature makes it unappealing to everyone except for the
Fish Queen. She has befriended the creature.

Rooms in the Palace
Throne Room
This is where the Empyreans gather to debate issues.
Much like Sydon's throne room in Praxys, a huge map of
Thylea dominates the center of the room.
Symbol Traps: Throne Room
The doors leading into the throne room are each
enchanted with a symbol of stunning that triggers when the
door is opened. The map of Thylea has a symbol of discord.

The Gardens
These gardens are more beautiful than any in Thylea.
Birds and beasts of all kinds can be found in the gardens.
Empyrean Bedrooms
Each of the Empyreans has their own luxurious bedroom. The walls are painted with gold and platinum.
The sheets are the finest silk.

Vineyards
The vineyards are lined with the lushest grape vines in
the world. Nymphs of all kinds walk through the vineyards, collecting the choicest grapes on golden trays to
be served to the Empyreans.
Pleasure Chambers
This is where the Empyreans come to play. There are
fountains of wine and tables filled with finely-cooked
meats. Keledones provide music.
Empyrean Pool
An enormous pool the size of a small lake fills this
chamber. The sides of the pool are mother of pearl and
the water depth is 100 feet. Beautiful fish, sharks, and
dolphins swim together in the water.
Empyrean Forge
A massive forge dominates this room. Giant-sized weapons and armor line the walls.
The Pit of Death
This pit descends a mile into darkness before opening up into the roof of the Nether Sea. There are two
thrones in the room: one is made from human bones,
and the other is made from writhing shadows.
Symbol Traps: The Pit
The doors leading into this chamber have symbols of
death inscribed upon them. The floor surrounding the
two thrones is inscribed with a symbol of insanity.

Preparedness
The setup of the palace depends on whether or not the
heroes catch the Empyreans by surprise. If surprised, the
Empyreans will converge on the Throne Room. The Lord
of Ghosts waits for the heroes in The Pit of Death. Several
erinyes may emerge from the Pit to aid him in a battle.
Lutheria will not engage the heroes in battle. She is
preoccupied preparing her "final joke."

BATTLE FOR GODHOOD

Lutheria's Final Joke

The stakes of this final battle are clear: who will take on
the mantle of the new pantheon? The victors will rule all
the lands of Thylea from the Empyrean Palace.




The Empyreans stand in a half-circle around the throne
room. Each is clad in a blinding aura of light, radiant
mithral armor, and priceless gemstones. They tower
over you, and their eyes burn with ancient power.
"You have shown yourselves to be worthy foes. But
Thylea has no more need of Dragonlords. We offer you
one final chance-submit to us as your new gods, or
we will have no choice but to destroy you."




The Empyreans fight to the death, since they are
supremely confident of victory. However, they are not
true gods yet-they are still waiting for Lutheria to fulfill
a sacred oath that she swore to them.
Lutheria's Oath. In anticipation of this battle,
Lutheria swore an oath to use the theogenesis spell to
transform the Empyreans into true gods. As the battle
turns against the Empyreans, they shout out to Lutheria
to cast the spell and fulfill her part of the oath. But even
as they grow desperate, she refuses to comply.
Sphere of Annihilation. Lutheria has conjured a
sentient sphere of annihilation and dotes on it like a pet.
The sphere is 1 ft. in diameter and follows her around.

Lutheria set the Apokalypsis in motion and convinced
the Empyreans to take advantage of the chaos, but she
never truly intended to allow them to become gods. Her
plan is much more sinister.
Lutheria intends to transform her sphere of annihilation into an all-consuming god of oblivion. This new
god will tear a hole in the fabric of reality, swallowing everything-the entire world of Thylea, gods and
mortals alike. Each time one of the Empyreans falls in
combat, she harvests their soul, and her pet sphere of
annihilation doubles in size.
Preventing Oblivion. In order to create the
god, Lutheria needs to collect the souls of all eight
Empyreans. She watches the battle from the sidelines,
laughing at the Empyreans as they fall in combat. She
does not attack the heroes-in fact, she cheers them on,
and she may even join in the battle to help them.
The only way to prevent Lutheria's plan from succeeding is to spare at least one of the Empyreans from
death. When there are only 2-3 Empyreans remaining,
they realize this and beg the heroes for mercy.
Final Resolution. When the battle is finished, the
Furies arrive and pronounce judgment on Lutheria: she
has broken her oath to the Empyreans, violating the
most fundamental rule of godhood. As she slowly dissolves away into nothingness, Lutheria laughs uncontrollably at the irony of it all. The surviving Empyreans
swear eternal fealty to the heroes.

Epilogue
THE DRAGONLORDS

If the heroes are victorious, then they are immortalized as
the saviors of all the lands of Thylea, and the Dragonlords
are remembered forever as the heralds of a new age for
mortals and gods alike.
This is an appropriate place for your players to retire
their heroes and create fresh characters, so that they can
take on more mundane challenges once again. When
future campaigns take place in Thylea, the heroes from
this campaign might be the venerable, beleaguered kings
and queens who send young adventurers on quests.

THE NEW PANTHEON

It's also possible that the heroes have fulfilled all the
necessary prerequisites to become gods, according to
the rules laid out in the Divine Path appendix.
In this case, ask each of your players to write up an
appropriate epilogue for their personal ascension to
godhood. Future campaigns in Thylea should make
use of this new pantheon of gods. If the heroes were
natives of Thylea, then they might send future adventurers on quests to explore the world beyond the
Forgotten Land.

The legend of the new Dragonlords will go down in history as perhaps the greatest ever told. From the deaths of gods
and dragons to the birth of new pantheons, these heroes have risen to the demands of Fate and surmounted obstacles
that no mortal should ever be forced to confront. This is the dawn of a new era... perhaps not one of long-lasting
peace, but a time when the gods are no longer at war with one another. At last, we are free to forge our own fates.
