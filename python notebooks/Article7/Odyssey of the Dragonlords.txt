Heroes of the Prophecy
'No, husband, the mortals no longer heed
your storms. Let us instead send a great beast to
defile the lands they stole from us. I am sure that
they will appreciate the irony.'

S

-Lutheria, the Lady of Dreams

ydon and Lutheria, the Twin Titans, have
corrupted the heart of an ancient boar and
unleashed it in the verdant countryside east of
the City of Estoria. They hope to create fear in
the people of Thylea so that the mortals will abandon
their worship of the Five Gods. The Oath of Peace once
protected the human settlers from the Titans, but now
the magic of the oath is weakening. This is a small taste
of the devastation to come.

Kyrah has summoned the heroes to hunt the boar and
put an end to the devastation that it is causing. Once the
beast has been slain, the carcass should be burned as a
sacrifice to one of the gods or Titans. Great fame and
riches are promised to those who make such offerings.
The Order of Sydon has demanded that the boar be an
offering to Sydon, the Lord of Storms, but everyone in
the world knows that such offerings can alter the balance of power among the gods.


We gods can only do so much to keep the peace,
especially when the priests abandon our temples.
In these dark times, it is we who must have faith
in mortals, rather than the other way around.
- Kyrah, Goddess of Music

The future of Thylea looks grim. Monsters menace
the roads, and corruption threatens the cities. The
storm god Sydon demands daily sacrifices at every
temple, and his sister-wife Lutheria kidnaps children for her secret rituals. The Five Gods, who once
protected the settlers, are silent. And now, the Oracle
has prophesied the Doom of Thylea: the death of
gods, the destruction of Mytros, and the total annihilation of the mortal races.
You are one of a group of warriors who have been
summoned to the Heartlands in an attempt to avert
this coming catastrophe. You each have reasons for
answering the call, but rumors of your coming have
already spread across the land.




The Sour Vintage




Kyrah
the Poet

The Sour Vintage is a traditional country inn located at
a crossroads, about twenty miles east of the City of
Estoria. The exterior is rustic wood painted black, and
the sign hanging from the door depicts a woman carrying a basket full of grapes. Inside the tavern, a haze of
pleasant tobacco smoke lingers in the air. You hear the
clinking of mugs and the muttering of patrons, most of
whom are farmers.
You have been summoned here by a woman named
Kyrah who wants to hire you for a 'difficult task'. She
has promised a sizable reward, and more information
about the Oracle's prophecy.




The Poet from Mytros
Kyrah (see appendix) has been sent by Versi the Oracle,
but she is using the identity of a poet, one of some skill
and renown. It is Kyrah's task to gather the heroes from
the oracle's vision and ensure that they live up to their
potential. Kyrah knows all of the rumors that have been
circulating about the heroes, and she takes a moment to
recognize their unique talents.




A dark-haired woman calls you over to a table in the
corner. She wears a white traveling dress with practical leather boots, and she carries a large satchel that
appears to contain dozens of scrolls, along with plentiful writing supplies.
'Greetings, I am Kyrah. Thank you for answering my
summons. I will be direct. I am here as an agent of the
Oracle. She believes that great destinies await you all,
but great destinies are forged by great deeds.
'A terrifying giant boar has been laying waste to the
Heartlands, slaughtering everything in its path. This boar
was corrupted by the Titans and sent to punish the mortals of Thylea for their continued faith in the Five Gods.
Many have attempted to hunt the boar. All have failed.
'If you wish to win fame and fortune, as great heroes
should, then you must prove to the people of Thylea
that you are the warriors of the Oracle's prophecy.
Hunt this boar and offer it to the gods as a sacrifice.'


Kyrah's Identity
Kyrah is actually the goddess of music and makes little
effort to disguise her identity, but she behaves like any
other mortal woman. If anyone suggests that she might
be more than she lets on, she feigns innocence and
changes the subject. The locals recognize her as a poet
from Mytros, but most will assume that she has merely
been blessed with the appearance of the goddess.

The poet offers the heroes assistance in accomplishing
this task. She has hired two hunters who can help track
down the corrupted boar. They will be waiting outside
of the tavern an hour before dawn. She also offers the
heroes a reward for slaying the beast: a golden arrow
per hero worth 25 gp each. She will give the reward to
the heroes once the Oracle is satisfied that they are the
heroes from her vision.


Kyrah explains that the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria, have
always hated the mortals of Thylea. For five hundred
years, their hatred has been shackled by the Oath of
Peace. Now, the power of the Oath has waned, and this
ancient beast is one of many signs that they are plotting
war upon Mytros once again.

Staying the Night
The heroes can spend the rest of the night drinking
and speaking to the locals. This is a good opportunity
for the heroes to learn about each other, as well as hear
of any recent events and rumors. Kyrah is willing to
answer any questions they may have about Thylea. The
heroes may also purchase basic supplies from Aetala,
the innkeeper.

Spreading Rumors
If your players have prepared rumors about themselves,
now is a good time to distribute them around the table.
This is an opportunity for your players to roleplay their
characters and get to know each other better.

The Innkeeper
The innkeeper is a retired hunter named Aetala (NG
veteran). She knows the Heartlands better than most,
and she has all the rumors from Estoria. She recognizes
at least one of the heroes, and she suggests that they
hunt the boar. Aetala made her fortune hunting a similar
beast decades ago.

The beasts of Thylea are not like those

Injured Hunting Party
These hunters are recovering from minor injuries
sustained while hunting the boar. They set a trap for
the beast by laying twenty pounds of rotten fruit in the
middle of a field and hiding in the surrounding hedges.
The boar took them by surprise. It gored one of their
friends with its tusks and dragged him into the woods.
They tried to follow but the sounds were too horrible,
and so they came here to drink to the memory of their
dead friend.

Forlorn Farmers
Most of the other patrons in the tavern are farmers
who are too frightened to tend their fields. Their
families are holed up inside farmhouse basements, or
else they've fled to the safety of Estoria until the beast
has been killed. If any of the farmers recognize the
heroes, they become angry with them: why aren't they
out hunting the boar? What else are heroes good for,
anyway?

Hunting the Boar
Kyrah and the two hunters are waiting outside the
tavern an hour before dawn. The hunters are named
Taneias and Javon (LG scouts). The morning is cold and
foggy, and the ground is wet with dew. The hunters lead
the party away from the tavern and deep into the hills to
the north. The party passes many farms and settlements
that have been destroyed by the corrupted boar.




As you make your way northward into the Heartlands,
you pass many ravaged farms and settlements, all
attacked by the boar. The rocks and trees along the
road have been gouged by its tusks, leaving deep,
ragged trenches. Carrion crows flock in the fields,
picking at the bodies of failed hunters and unfortunate settlers.




The party should make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival)
check to attempt to track the corrupted boar. A failure means the heroes spend an entire day in fruitless
searching. You may choose to run one random plains
encounter during the hunt, whether or not they succeed on this check.
Kyrah will not fight in any of the heroes' battles. She will
stay away from enemies and make meticulous notes for
an epic poem about the struggle. She will, however, do
her best to help the heroes by keeping their spirits up.
If the heroes appear to be in grave danger, she may sing
one of her songs to lend aid. If a hero dies, she will wait
until the danger has passed and then use her raise dead
scrolls to bring them back to life, invoking the power of
Mytros, the goddess, to do so.

THE BOAR'S CAVE

- Rope Snare. This trap requires 50 ft. of rope. It will

entangle the boar's legs, cutting its movement speed
in half and preventing it from using any charge abilities. Setting it requires a Survival DC 12 skill check.
- Spiked Pitfall. This trap requires someone to dig a
hole 10 ft. deep and fill it with sharpened wooden
stakes. If the boar fails to leap over it, it will take 3d6
piercing damage and become immobilized. Digging
the pitfall requires Survival DC 20 skill check.
- Spiked Barricade. This trap requires setting up a row
of sharpened stakes, angled toward the cave mouth.
If the boar runs into the barricade, it will take 2d6
piercing damage. Constructing the barrier requires a
Survival DC 12 skill check.
At this point, have the party make DC 16 Wisdom
(Perception) checks. Anyone who fails to make the
check is surprised during the following battle. One of
the hunters is killed as soon as the boar appears:




Suddenly, you hear a bestial grunt from inside the cave.
A massive boar suddenly charges from the cave mouth,
goring one of the hunters on its tusks! Tossing the body
away like a ragdoll, the creature draws itself up to its
full height. It's an ancient white boar with fierce red
eyes and bloodied yellow tusks.


Eventually, the party stumbles upon a cave in the hills
where the boar has dragged its most recent kills. The
boar is inside the cave, messily devouring a couple of
unfortunate scouts.


From this height, you can see miles of mountainous
hills to the west. A thick blanket of fog hangs over the
lower land, and you can hear a gentle chorus of birds
greeting the morning sun. Eventually, you pick up the
boar's trail: another path of wanton destruction, split
tree trunks, and splatters of blood. The trail ends at
the shadowy mouth of a cave. Ear-splitting grunts and
squeals echo from inside.


The party may choose to set a variety of traps for the
boar. Each trap requires a successful Wisdom (Survival)
skill check to assemble. Failing the check causes someone to stumble and make a loud noise, at which the boar
becomes alerted to the party's presence. Possibilities for
traps include:

Encounter: The Boar Attacks

Kyrah's Assistance



Setting Traps



The great boar has several spears and arrows lodged
in its back, all the result of failed attempts to kill it. The
boar is bleeding from these wounds, causing it to suffer
one level of exhaustion at the end of each of its turns
in combat. Sensing that it is surrounded, it will try to
attack each hero at least once.

Death of the Boar



The boar fights until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at
this point it can be captured with a net and bound
with ropes. Once captured, the boar locks eyes with
the heroes and speaks its dying words directly into
their minds. Everyone hears its booming voice inside
their heads:

'Know this, mortals. Your sins cannot be atoned. An
ancient power sleeps in the heart of Thylea, and when
it awakens, the age of Mytros will come to an end.
Just as my broken body falls to ruin and decay, so too
all mortal things will come to death and darkness. No
prophecy will save you.'


recommends not making the offering to either Sydon
or Lutheria, as such an act will only strengthen their
dominion over the lands of Thylea.
Reactions to the Sacrifical Offering
Diety

The weather is beautiful for one week.
The Order of Sydon is pleased.

Lutheria

Lutheria grants one hero the blessing of
protection during her first dream.

Mytros

All heroes gain the charm of heroism and
are protected from Lutheria's madness
during the first dream.

Volkan

Volkan grants the heroes one random
magic item upon meeting them.

Kyrah

Pythor

Pythor swears an oath of service to the
heroes upon meeting them.

Vallus

Vallus grants the heroes a scarab of protection upon meeting them.

None

Hurricanes and earthquakes. The heroes
are transformed into goats for one day.



The boar's cave is only 50 ft. deep, and it's full of stinking water, gore, and boar dung. If the heroes decide to
wade into the disgusting mess in the cave and explore,
there is some treasure to be found.
Treasure
The two shredded corpses inside the cave may be
searched. Between them, they have 25 gp and 37 sp. One
of them carried a silvered spear. Kyrah points out that
it is customary to bury or burn the dead, and that each
body should have two gold pieces placed on its eyes, the
expected payment for the Ferryman.

Sacrifice to the Gods
Once everyone has drawn breath and tended their
wounds, Kyrah reminds everyone that the dying boar
should be offered as a sacrifice to the gods. This is the
way of things in Thylea, and it will be a great offense to
both the gods and the people of Mytros if the beast does
not die as a proper offering. Whichever god receives this
sacrifice will grow in power as a result.
The heroes should collect wood to construct a sacrificial bier around the beast. Then, they must decide
which god will receive the sacrifice. Kyrah will remind
the heroes that the Order of Sydon demanded that the
boar be sacrificed to the Lord of Storms. She strongly

The chosen Ones
Whatever happens, the boar-slaying heroes are now
celebrated as the Oracle's Chosen Ones. The people of
Thylea will expect them to travel to the Temple of the
Oracle and discover what great destiny awaits them.

Temple of the Oracle
'Never trust the words of that witch,
Versi. She once claimed that she saw no great
deeds in my future, but look now-am I not the
King of Mytros?'



Though others failed, you slew the corrupted boar
that plagued the lands west of Mytros. Your names are
everywhere celebrated as the Heroes of the Heartlands.
Now, you have come to the Temple of the Oracle to
claim your reward.
Kyrah has promised that you will learn more of your
destiny from the water nymph, Versi, the legendary
Oracle who brokered the Oath of Peace. She is the
daughter of Sydon, the Lord of Storms, but she has
always been an ally to the mortals of Thylea.
But Kyrah has heard nothing from her in two weeks,
and now she fears that something may have happened
to the Oracle.

-King Acastus, on the Oracle of Thylea
The Temple of the Oracle is the fabled home of Versi,
an ancient naiad, a water nymph, with the gift of
prophecy. She has recently issued a dire warning to the
people of Mytros-the Doom of Thylea is nigh, and
only the great heroes from her vision can rescue the
land from total destruction.
