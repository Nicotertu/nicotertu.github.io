This website functions as a portfolio where I document my journey in learning about data science and artificial intelligence, a platform to share my progress, insights, and experiences as I delve into various topics in the field.

Here, you will find a collection of articles, tutorials, and projects covering a range of subjects, including data visualization, data analysis, computer vision, deep learning, machine learning, and more. Through these posts, I aim to offer valuable information and share the lessons I've learned along the way.
